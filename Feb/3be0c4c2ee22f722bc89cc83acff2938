A frigid February for Wall Street closed out with more losses on Tuesday, with the S&P 500 falling 0.3% to to 3,970.15, locking in a loss of 2.6% for the month. The Dow fell 232.39 to 32,656.70, and the Nasdaq dropped 11.44 to 11,455.54. Both also sank over the month. After a strong start to the year bolstered by hopes that inflation was on the way down, Wall Street shifted into reverse in February. A stream of data showed inflation and the overall economy are remaining more resilient than expected. That’s forced investors to raise their forecasts for how high the Federal Reserve will take interest rates and how long it will keep them there.ADVERTISEMENTHigh rates can drive down inflation, but they also raise the risk of a recession down the line because they hurt the economy. They also drag on prices for stocks and other investments. Heightened expectations for rates sent yields jumping in the bond market Tuesday. The yield on the 10-year Treasury held steady at 3.92%. It helps set rates for mortgages and other loans that shape the economy’s health, and still near its highest level since November. The two-year yield, which moves more on expectations for Fed action, ticked up to 4.81% from 4.78%. It’s near its highest level since 2007. Reports on the economy released Tuesday showed some slight cracks. One said that confidence among U.S. consumers unexpectedly fell in February. Another said that manufacturing in the Chicago region weakened by more than expected. ADVERTISEMENTIn energy trading, benchmark U.S. crude added 43 cents to $77.48 a barrel.
