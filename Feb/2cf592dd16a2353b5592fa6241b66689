ROME (AP) — Winger Ethan Dumortier will make his debut for defending champion France in its Six Nations opener against Italy in Rome on Sunday.Dumortier, who won the under-20 world championship in 2019 with France, is the Top 14’s leading try-scorer with eight in 11 games for Lyon and has added three more in two Champions Cup games.Gabin Villière, who scored three tries against Italy a year ago, was in contention to start after recovering from a shin fracture, but he injured his ankle in training on Wednesday. Coach Fabien Galthié said Villière might be fit to face Ireland in Dublin next week.It has been a meteoric rise for Dumortier, who first came to France’s Marcoussis training camp two years ago and wasn’t sure which path to choose.“He was navigating between the France Sevens team and (club side) Lyon. He was caught between the two,” Galthié said. “He already made a big impression on us when he came to work with us.”ADVERTISEMENTGalthié praised Villière’s “mentality and motivation” as he tried to prove his fitness after playing just 60 minutes with Toulon since returning from injury.“He didn’t want to give up the jersey,” Galthié said. “He was ready and came to test himself in training sessions, uncompromising ones. Unfortunately he got hurt.”RugbySix Nations: England launches new era against ScotlandGatland wants focus on rugby as Wales meets top-ranked Irish6N: Revamped England drops Tuilagi and Scotland drops PriceWelsh choir won't sing 'Delilah' amid rugby sexism claimsLock Paul Willemse returns after missing the last five tests with a knee injury. Thomas Ramos was at fullback ahead of elite kicker Melvyn Jaminet, with Les Tricolores approaching the tournament with the intent of playing a more attacking style despite a 13-game winning streak.The versatile Yoram Moefana gave up his place on the wing to Dumortier but slips into midfield alongside veteran Gaël Fickou.Uncapped Racing 92 scrumhalf Nolann Le Garrec was in the reserves.Tommaso Menoncello reappears in the Six Nations for the first time since the same fixture a year ago, his Italy debut. That day in Paris, he scored the opening try from a crosskick and became the youngest try-scorer in the championship in 55 years at age 19.Menoncello was a try-scoring wing again in the historic loss to Georgia last June. He’s normally in midfield for Benetton but he’s on the wing for the departed Montanna Ioane, who has gone to Super Rugby.Tommaso Allan and Stephen Varney were Italy’s halves for a third straight test while Paolo Garbisi recovers from a knee ligament injury.ADVERTISEMENTSeven of the pack are from Benetton, the outlier being London Irish loosehead Danilo Fischetti.Vannes lock Edoardo Iachizzi, who was called up for the injured Marco Fuser, could make his debut from the bench. The forwards-backs reserves were split 6-2, like France’s. Edoardo Padovani, the winning try-scorer against Wales last year, was covering flyhalf, the wings and fullback.Coach Kieran Crowley said Saracens prop Marco Riccioni and Gloucester flanker Jake Polledri, who were both coming back from long layoffs, were still absorbing Italy’s game plan and would probably be considered for the match next week against England.Italy is a heavy underdog against France but hopes to be competitive.ADVERTISEMENT“We will try to exploit the space that we think there may be, but to do this we will have to win the battle up front or at least gain parity, and this is the big challenge for us,” Crowley said. “France are very competitive in the tackle, strong in the scrum and in the drive from the lineout.“We are satisfied with how we we have prepared and we will be satisfied if we bring the mentality with which we prepared for the match onto the field.” ___Lineups:Italy: Ange Capuozzo, Pierre Bruno, Juan Ignacio Brex, Luca Morisi, Tommaso Menoncello, Tommaso Allan, Stephen Varney; Lorenzo Cannone, Michele Lamaro (captain), Sebastian Negri, Federico Ruzza, Niccolo Cannone, Simone Ferrari, Giacomo Nicotera, Danilo Fischetti.
