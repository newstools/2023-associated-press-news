LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) — Notre Dame star guard Olivia Miles left Sunday’s ACC game at Louisville with a right knee injury sustained while diving for a loose ball under the Irish basket late in the second quarter.Miles, who leads the No. 10 Irish with 14.7 points, 7.4 rebounds, 7.0 assists and 2.1 steals per game, was hurt with 2:35 remaining before halftime. The sophomore became emotional and pounded the floor while being examined by medical personnel. Miles was able to flex her knee and eventually limped off the floor without assistance to applause as she made her way to the locker room. Miles favored the right leg as she talked with family members and walked gingerly back into the locker room. She eventually returned to the bench midway through the third quarter with her right knee wrapped in ice.The 5-foot-10 guard’s versatility on both ends of the floor has made her one of women’s college basketball’s rising stars. Miles leads the Atlantic Coast Conference and ranks fifth nationally in assists and has recorded 10 double-doubles this season.ADVERTISEMENTMiles last spring became the first freshman (man or woman) to post a triple-double in the NCAA Tournament and is on the watch list for several national awards.___AP women’s college basketball: https://apnews.com/hub/womens-college-basketball and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-womens-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25
