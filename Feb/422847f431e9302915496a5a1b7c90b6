MARSEILLE, France (AP) — The Olympic flame is going for a sail.Instead of arriving overland, the symbolic flame alighting the 2024 Paris Games will take to the seas from its birthplace in Greece, arriving aboard a three-masted tall ship in the French port of Marseille.Paris organizers announced the flame’s journey on Friday at City Hall in Marseille, a former Greek colony founded 2,600 years ago.According to tradition, the flame will be lit by the sun’s rays at a ceremony in Ancient Olympia. Then it will be carried by the Olympic torch to Athens and across the Mediterranean to the famed Old Port of Marseille, where the flame will be greeted by an armada of boats along the French coastline, organizers said.It will travel to the Marseille marina -- where Olympic sailing competitions will be based -- and the Marseille stadium hosting Olympic soccer games, according to the organizers.ADVERTISEMENTAfter that it will be carried overland in the traditional torch relay, before arriving in Paris to light the cauldron and officially open the 2024 Games, which run July 26-Aug. 11.Friday’s announcement came as the general assembly of Ukraine’s National Olympic Committee was meeting in Kyiv to discuss a possible boycott of Paris 2024 if Russian athletes are allowed to compete.SportsLeBron’s off-court legacy complements his basketball successUkraine steps up efforts to exclude Russia from OlympicsAnalysis: Eagles weren't afraid to make difficult decisionsFord returns to Formula One in partnership with Red BullThe International Olympic Committee last week sought to chart a path for athletes from Russia and Belarus who have not actively supported the war in Ukraine to join the Paris Olympics.
