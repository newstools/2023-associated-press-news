WASHINGTON (AP) — On a team ranked as high as No. 2 this season, it was a freshman who saved the day for UConn. Adama Sanogo and Tristen Newton each scored 15 and Alex Karaban knocked down two late 3-pointers as No. 24 UConn held for a 68-62 win at last-place Georgetown on Saturday. “We’re lucky to have him in a UConn uniform,” coach Dan Hurleyy said about Karaban, who came into the game as the Huskies fourth-leading scorer, averaging 9.7. “There’s not many freshmen in the country that have been as consistent, solid.”Despite leading for most of the game, the heavily favored Huskies (18-6, 7-6 Big East) needed a late 8-1 run to earn the season sweep over the Hoyas. UConn has won two straight and three of four. Brandon Murray’s three-point play with 4:42 left put the Hoyas on top at 61-60. It was Georgetown’s first lead since the 16:16 mark in the first half. Murray scored 14 of his game-high 21 points after halftime for the Hoyas (6-18, 1-12), who have lost six straight games to UConn. ADVERTISEMENTIt was a game far closer than expected as UConn began the day at No. 8 in the Net Rankings while Georgetown sat near the bottom.“This would have been a tough one in terms of the metrics and everything that’s at stake for us,” Hurley said. “There was a lot of pressure on us, in that under four timeout, because the group knew we could ill afford to come and lose here.”College basketballSiegrist, No. 19 Villanova women roll past Butler 78-58No. 7 Utah women outlast Oregon State 75-73 in overtimeNo. 22 Arizona rallies to beat No. 14 UCLA in OT, 71-66Pili, No. 7 Utah hold off Oregon State 75-73 in overtimeThat’s when Karaban, who was scoreless at halftime, provided the spark.Karaban knocked down a 3-pointer from the top of the key with 3:03 left to restore the UConn lead at 63-61.
