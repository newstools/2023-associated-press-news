SAN DIEGO (AP) — Yu Darvish has agreed to a new contract with the San Diego Padres that guarantees the 36-year-old ace an additional $90 million and will keep him with the club through the 2028 season, a person with direct knowledge of the deal said Thursday.The person spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the deal hadn’t been announced.The right-hander, who has a baffling array of pitches, will make $108 million over six years, including the $18 million he was already due in 2023 before he was set to become a free agent. He’s set to stay under contract with San Diego until he’s 42.Darvish helped the Padres reach the NL Championship Series last season, which was one of the best in his 11-year big league career. He finished the year 16-8 with a 3.10 ERA and 197 strikeouts. He was 2-1 in the postseason.Darvish was traded by the Cubs to the Padres in 2020.ADVERTISEMENTThe deal is the latest by the free-spending Padres. Darvish heads a rotation that also includes hometown product Joe Musgrove, who signed a $100 million, five-year deal in July. They signed shortstop Xander Bogaerts to a $280 million, 11-year deal in December even though Fernando Tatis Jr. will be eligible to return April 20 from an 80-game suspension after testing positive for a performance-enhancing drug. Tatis will move to the outfield.MLBAstros beat Tucker in arbitration, Ramirez 3rd Rays hearingMLB prepared to take over local TV broadcasts from SinclairPush-button pitching: MLB to let pitchers call own signalsTrout, Betts, Ohtani among 8 MVPs in World Baseball ClassicThere could be more big spending ahead for the Padres, who are still seeking their first World Series championship.
