EDMONTON, Alberta (AP) — Pius Suter scored the winner in the fifth round of the shootout, leading the Detroit Red Wings to a 5-4 victory over the Edmonton Oilers on Wednesday night.Dylan Larkin, Moritz Seider, Robby Fabbri and Olli Maatta scored in regulation for the Red Wings, who have won four straight. Ville Husso made 41 saves overall.“It was a huge team win being up 4-2 and they tied it up and still getting away with two points,” Suter said. “In different games, you have to find different ways to score.“Today, it was a couple of faceoff plays, our special teams were good and that’s how you keep winning.”Ryan Nugent-Hopkins had a pair of goals, and Leon Draisaitl and Derek Ryan also scored for the Oilers, who have dropped their last two. Jack Campbell stopped 19 of 23 shots.“We had a couple of breakdowns that they capitalized on,” Draisaitl said. “They really didn’t get much. I thought we dominated the entire game, pretty much.ADVERTISEMENT“It was definitely frustrating, but it is hard to win in this league when you give up four.”Detroit opened the scoring 4:17 into the first period on Larkin’s power-play goal — the fourth straight game in which he has scored.The Red Wings made it 2-0 when Seider sent a backhand shot from the corner toward the net and it caromed off defenseman Philip Broberg, the post and then Campbell before going in.NHLFlames host the Red Wings after Dube's 2-goal gameNew York takes losing streak into game against PittsburghBlackhawks bring losing streak into matchup with the SenatorsRangers aim to keep win streak alive, visit the OilersNugent-Hopkins got the Oilers on the scoreboard 1:26 into the second period, but Fabbri restored Detroit’s two-goal edge on the power play at 9:06.Edmonton made it a one-goal game just over two minutes later as Connor McDavid sent a one-handed pass across the crease to Nugent-Hopkins, who recorded his 26th goal of the season in his 55th game.

And I thought, for the most part, we managed the game fairly well tonight and Husse was probably the difference in a tight game on the road.”UP NEXTRed Wings: At Calgary on Thursday night in the third of a five-game trip.Oilers: Host New York Rangers on Friday night to finish a two-game homestand.___AP NHL: https://www.apnews.com/hub/NHL and https://www.twitter.com/AP_Sports
