LeBron James and the Los Angeles Lakers are getting a national television audience on Saturday.Just in case.With James closing in on Kareem Abdul-Jabbar’s career scoring record, the NBA has moved the Lakers’ game at New Orleans up two hours to a 6 p.m. Eastern start. The Lakers-Pelicans game will also be aired on ESPN2, preceding a national broadcast between Dallas and Golden State at 8:30 p.m. on ABC.James and the Lakers play at Indiana on Thursday. He will enter that game needing 89 points to pass Abdul-Jabbar, who has been the league’s leading scorer since 1984.NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said last month in Paris, when asked about the league’s plans for James’ potential record-breaking game, that the league “would look at making sure that game isn’t just national in the United States but globally available if he’s anywhere within a reasonable amount of points of breaking that record.”ADVERTISEMENTJames is averaging 30.2 points per game. At that pace, the record-breaker is likely to be Tuesday when the Lakers host Oklahoma City — provided James doesn’t miss any games in the interim. The NBA has not yet said how, or if, the Lakers-Thunder game would be nationally televised.
