SEATTLE (AP) — Dylan Moore and the Seattle Mariners have agreed to a three-year contract worth $8,875,000, avoiding a salary arbitration hearing, two people familiar with the deal told The Associated Press.The people spoke on condition of anonymity Wednesday night because the agreement, first reported by ESPN, had not been announced.Moore had asked for a raise from $1.35 million to $2.25 million, and the Mariners had offered $1.9 million when proposed arbitration figures were exchanged on Jan. 13.The 30-year-old utilityman would have been eligible for free agency after the 2024 World Series, but the new agreement pushes that back a year.Moore played every position except pitcher and catcher last year, including 39 games in right field, seven in center, 18 in left, two at third base, 26 at shortstop, 12 at second, eight at first and three at designated hitter.He is expected to play more second base this season, sharing time with Kolten Wong, and also is likely to spell J.P. Crawford at shortstop. ADVERTISEMENTMoore was selected by Texas in the seventh round of the 2015 amateur draft, traded to Atlanta a year later and then released by the Braves in March 2018. He signed with Milwaukee, was released at the end of the season and then signed with Seattle that November.MLBNo lease extension, but O's and governor tout partnershipMariners hope offseason additions have closed gap in AL WestBatting champ Arraez, Marlins go to salary arbitrationChavez, Pillar highlight non-roster invitees to Braves campMoore made his big league debut in March 2019 when Seattle played Oakland in Tokyo.He hit .224 with six homers and 24 RBIs last year, down from 12 homers, 43 RBIs and a .181 batting average in 2021. Moore is a .208 career hitter with 35 homers and 112 RBIs.Seattle defeated Diego Castillo on Wednesday in the first salary arbitration decision this year, and the relief pitcher will get a raise to $2.95 million rather than his request of $3,225,000. Outfielder Teoscar Hernández, acquired by the Mariners from Toronto, also remains on track for a hearing. He asked for a raise from $10.65 million to $16 million, and Seattle offered $14 million.___AP Baseball Writer Ronald Blum in New York contributed to this report.___AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb and https://twitter.com/AP_Sport
