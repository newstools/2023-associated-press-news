CHONBURI, Thailand (AP) — Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark claimed his seventh European tour title with a four-shot victory in the Thailand Classic at the Amata Spring Country Club on Sunday.Starting the final round two shots ahead of countryman Nicolai Hojgaard and Yannik Paul of Germany, the Dane never let anyone threaten him as he cruised through the last 18 holes with an error-free 66 to win on 24-under 264, four ahead of the German.After two spectacular birdies on the 13th and 14th, Olesen never looked back. “I had some good chances to make birdies but I didn’t capitalize on them. Then it was a bonus to make birdies on two tough holes. It made me feel a little more comfortable. I felt steady and felt in control,” said the 33-year-old Olesen who had three birdies on the front nine and three more on the back. The win marked his first title in Asia and is his first since the British Masters in May 2022.ADVERTISEMENT“It’s very special... It’s been a long time since I last won on a tour,” said Olsen, who will return to the world top 100 next week. One-time European tour winner Paul finished with five birdies and one bogey to sign off with a 68 and a total 20-under 268 in second.Alexander Knappe of Germany, with a dazzling performance on the back nine where he managed seven birdies, finished with a 67 for 270 to finish joint-third along with Dutchman Joost Luiten (69).___AP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports
