TJ Bamba also scored 11 points for Washington State (13-15, 8-9 Pac-12) but made just 5 of 17 from the field and Andrej Jakimovski added 10 points. Justin Powell hit a 3-pointer before Gueye and Bamba each made a layup in a 7-2 run but Keeshawn Barthelemy hit a pull-up 3 to cut Oregon’s deficit to 66-65 with 1:20 left. Bamba missed a fade-away jumper in the lane, DJ Rodman grabbed the offensive rebound and was fouled before Powell missed a jumper and Jakimovski grabbed another offensive rebound. Following a WSU timeout, Powell went around a screen by Gueye on the left wing, patiently worked his way through the lane and finished high off the backboard on the other side of the rim to make it 68-65 with 23 seconds to go.ADVERTISEMENTJermaine Couisnard missed a open look at a potential tying 3-pointer in the closing seconds.
