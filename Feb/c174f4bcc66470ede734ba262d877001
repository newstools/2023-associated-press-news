DUBLIN (AP) — Ireland prop Finlay Bealham has been ruled out of the remainder of the Six Nations because of the left knee he injured in the win over Italy on Saturday.Bealham was forced off in the first half and put on a knee brace while watching the 34-20 win in Rome.Tom O’Toole replaced Bealham.The tighthead started all three of Ireland’s matches while first-choice Tadhg Furlong was rehabbing a calf issue. Furlong is fit and in contention to return to action in the next match of unbeaten Ireland’s title bid against Scotland on March 12 at Murrayfield.The rest of Ireland’s injury list shortened considerably, the Irish Rugby Football Union said on Monday.Captain Jonathan Sexton and Garry Ringrose were recovered from the groin and calf complaints that sidelined them from the Italy game. Also, scrumhalf Jamison Gibson-Park was over a hamstring injury and center Robbie Henshaw was back from a wrist issue.Their return was timely and welcome for Ireland, which has the Scots and England remaining to try and complete a rare Grand Slam. ___More AP rugby: https://apnews.com/hub/rugby and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports
