CARDIFF, Wales (AP) â€” Dan Biggar was demoted to the bench and George North was dropped from the squad entirely as Wales coach Warren Gatland made more big calls for the Six Nations match against England on Saturday.It has already been a tumultuous week for Welsh rugby, with its players only backing down from the threat of strike action on Wednesday amid a contractual dispute with authorities.Now much of the talk will be about another intriguing selection from Gatland, who is searching for the right combination in his team after losses to Ireland and Scotland at the start of his second spell in charge of Wales.Owen Williams was preferred to Biggar at flyhalf when Gatland named his team on Thursday while North was replaced at center by 20-year-old Mason Grady, who will make his international debut. As part of a heavily reshuffled backline, Leigh Halfpenny came in for Liam Williams at fullback and Louis Rees-Zammit was fit enough to return on the wing in place of Rio Dyer.ADVERTISEMENTIn the pack, Gatland has reverted to experience with lock Alun Wyn Jones and back-row forwards Taulupe Faletau and Justin Tipuric all returning after being left out of the starting team for the loss at Murrayfield in Round 2. That brings nearly 350 test caps worth of experience back into the forwards.RugbyIreland gives Byrne, Casey first Six Nations starts vs ItalyEddie Jones looks to Super Rugby for Wallabies pointersStrike is off but issues abound in Welsh rugbyWales-England to go ahead in Six Nations after strike threatEngland made only one change to the team that started the 31-14 win over Italy two weeks ago, recalling Anthony Watson on the left wing in place of Ollie Hassell-CollinsLock Courtney Lawes was back on the bench after recovering from injury.___Lineups:Wales: Leigh Halfpenny, Josh Adams, Mason Grady, Joe Hawkins, Louis Rees-Zammit, Owen Williams, Tomos Williams; Taulupe Faletau, Justin Tipuric, Christ Tshiunza, Alun Wyn Jones, Adam Beard, Tomas Francis, Ken Owens (captain), Gareth Thomas.
