ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) — Three people in Albuquerque are dead after authorities found one victim lying in the middle of the street and followed a trail of blood to a shooting scene inside a home Thursday, police said.An off-duty New Mexico state police officer initially spotted the first victim in the roadway. The person appeared to have been stabbed, police spokesperson Gilbert Gallegos said. Police were called to the scene Thursday morning when neighbors reported hearing gunshots and the possibility of multiple people wounded.Officers found the other two victims inside a home with gunshot wounds, Gallegos said. A man was found locked inside a back room or bathroom. After talking to him, detectives did not think he was a suspect. Gallegos did not say whether the man was wounded. A gun was recovered from the scene.“There’s a lot of moving pieces with this. They’re investigating a lot of different possibilities,” Gallegos said. “We do not think there is an offender outstanding, but this is early in the investigation, and a firearm was found on scene, so that’s why investigators believe no one is outstanding in terms of a shooter.”ADVERTISEMENTDetectives are trying to determine the relationship between the people, and they had filed search warrants for the home and vehicles in the garage in hopes of trying to determine what happened.ShootingsAlec Baldwin pleads not guilty in shooting, can still workIRA dissidents suspected of shooting N Ireland detectiveTV reporter, 9-year-old girl fatally shot in Florida, authorities sayDetective: Colorado Springs club shooter ran neo-Nazi siteA first responder was also seen carrying a toddler on her hip as she walked away from the scene.
