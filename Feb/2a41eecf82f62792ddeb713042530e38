We’ve been here before with Scotland.An opening-round win over England in the Six Nations has sparked chatter about whether this, finally, could be the year the Scots put up a genuine challenge for a first title triumph this century.Indeed, it happened in each of the last two years — after an 11-6 victory at Twickenham in 2021 and a 20-17 victory over the auld enemy at Murrayfield in 2022.And what did Scotland go on to do in Round 2? Lose tight games to Wales both years.So, fans of the talented but underachieving boys in blue will likely head to Murrayfield with a certain amount of trepidation for the latest meeting with the Welsh on Saturday.“It’s already been a point of discussion in the group,” Scotland scrum coach Pieter de Villiers says.“Having a good win at Twickenham might have been such a moment of pleasure in the past that we might have been a bit slow to move on to the next game and that’s why I’m saying we can’t dwell on it. . . . We hope to show the growth this week.”ADVERTISEMENTScotland actually hasn’t won its opening two matches since 1996, but there are reasons to believe this year could be different — and it’s as much to do with the team Scotland will be facing.Wales appears to be in transition at the start of Warren Gatland’s second spell as coach, with his first two team selections highlighting the dilemma he is facing.RugbyJones' first test back on home soil against Pumas in SydneyIreland, France meet in potential Six Nations title deciderRugby team Worcester Warriors 'will disappear' after mergerCoaching conundrum, player departures rock All BlacksDoes Gatland stick with the old guard who were pillars in his first successful stint from 2008-19 — the likes of Alun Wyn Jones, Justin Tipuric and Taulupe Faletau, who all started the 34-10 loss to Ireland last week — or try to bring through some of the country’s promising youngsters in view of the Rugby World Cup?For the Scotland game, it’s the latter. Jones (156 caps) and Tipuric (90 caps) haven’t made the squad while Faletau, with his 96 caps, had to settle for a place among the reserves in a team featuring five changes in personnel — all in the pack.The inexperienced back row of Tommy Reffell, Christ Tshiunza and Jac Morgan has a combined age of 67, with Gatland saying he is “looking a bit to the future.”“We need to think about what’s important in this tournament — we still want to do well and Saturday is important — but we need to think long-term in the next seven or eight months,” Gatland says.ADVERTISEMENTOf the youngsters, he adds, “We don’t know how they can handle it.”Wales was blown away by the Irish inside the opening 30 minutes then the visitors eased up. Gatland felt his players held their own, which he is taking as a positive. Indeed, so happy was he with the inroads his backs made — for the paltry return of one try — that he selected an unchanged backline against Scotland.Gatland said he had never seen a stronger Scotland team during his time coaching in the Six Nations yet also noted the Scots’ penchant for following one good result with a bad one.“I’m sure what they are talking about this week is consistency,” he says.Scotland’s only change from 29-23 win over England has prop Zander Fagerson returning in place of WP Nel, who drops into the reserves.ADVERTISEMENTThe team needed a wonder try from Duhan van der Merwe in the first half, a try by the same winger late in the match and also a few mistakes by England to claim victory. For that reason, Scotland coach Gregor Townsend is taking nothing for granted going into the Doddie Weir Cup — named after the Scotland great who died last year at the age of 52.“After a defeat, that’s when a side comes out even stronger,” Townsend says. “They are fighting to stay in this championship, we are fighting to build on our win last week and be better.”___Lineups:Scotland: Stuart Hogg, Kyle Steyn, Huw Jones, Sione Tuipulotu, Duhan van der Merwe, Finn Russell, Ben White; Matt Fagerson, Luke Crosbie, Jamie Ritchie (captain), Grant Gilchrist, Richie Gray, Zander Ferguson, George Turner, Pierre Schoeman.
