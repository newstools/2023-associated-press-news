NEW YORK (AP) — LeBron James moved within 89 points of breaking the NBA’s career scoring record and climbed into fourth place on the assists list, finishing with a triple-double in his return to Madison Square Garden as the Los Angeles Lakers beat the New York Knicks 129-123 in overtime Tuesday night.James had 28 points, 11 assists and 10 rebounds, with the points giving him 38,299 for his career.
