NAPLES, Fla. (AP) — Bernhard Langer matched Hale Irwin’s PGA Tour Champions victory record of 45 on Sunday, winning the Chubb Classic for the fifth time.The 65-year-old Langer matched his age with a closing 7-under 65 for a three-stroke victory over Steve Stricker and Padraig Harrington. “It’s extremely special because we’ve been talking about it for so long, it seems now,” Langer said. “When I first came out here, I thought, `This is never going to happen.’”Langer finished at 17-under 199 on Tiburon Golf Club’s Black Course. At 65 years, 5 months, 23 days, the German star extended his record as the oldest winner. He holds the top three spots on the list.“Just right now, I just feel relieved and grateful and thankful for everybody that’s been on my team and helping me through these years, ” Langer said. “Like we said, for a German kid from a village of 800 people and starting as a caddie to do what I’ve done, it takes a lot of people to do that, not just one.”ADVERTISEMENTLanger also won Chubb titles in 2011, 2013, 2016 and 2022.Stricker shot a 66, and Harrington closed with a 65.“He continues to amaze us all.” Stricker said about Langer “He just keeps going, and he stays in shape. He’s just incredible, really. Forty-five wins, and he keeps winning, 65 years old, shot his age this week. I don’t know, there’s not much else you can say about him. And he’s a nice person, too. That’s, I think, the coolest part is he’s a good guy, a nice guy.”___AP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports
