MILWAUKEE (AP) — The Milwaukee Bucks sure didn’t let Giannis Antetokounmpo’s early exit bother them Friday night as they rolled to their most-lopsided victory of the season.Now they wait to learn whether they might have to continue playing without the two-time MVP Antetokounmpo left late in the first quarter with a right knee issue to spoil his rapid recovery from a sprained wrist, but the Bucks still trounced the Miami Heat 128-99 for their 13th consecutive triumph.“I haven’t gotten the full breakdown, but I’m pretty sure either on a a drive or on a screen or something like that, he knocked knees with somebody and just wasn’t able to return,” said Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer, who had no update beyond that.Antetokounmpo was in the starting lineup just four days after heading to New York to have his right wrist examined. “Sometimes you have to stop him from himself, being able to calm down and maybe even not play a couple of games, knowing that we’re No. 2 (in the East), knowing that we’re all right,” said Jrue Holiday, who had 24 points. “I know he doesn’t like it. He tries to play every single game, which I completely understand. I feel like I’m the same way.”ADVERTISEMENTAntetokounmpo was on the floor late in the first quarter when the two-time MVP passed the ball and immediately motioned to the bench as the Bucks called a timeout to enable him to head to the locker room.NBAKings outlast Clippers 176-175 in double overtimeMiami faces Charlotte, looks to halt 3-game slideThompson leads Golden State against Minnesota after 42-point gameLillard and the Trail Blazers play the RocketsHe had four points, four rebounds and four assists in just six minutes.The Bucks still had no trouble extending the longest winning streak in the NBA this season.

He drew perhaps his biggest ovation of the night when the scoreboard video caught him joining the crowd singalong to the Backstreet Boys’ “I Want It That Way” during a timeout late in the fourth quarter. “That’s a classic song,” Holiday said. “And we were winning.
