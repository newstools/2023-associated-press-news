Hopefully as my minutes keep going (up), I keep the same mindset, because it’s been working.”The Bucks withstood a triple-double from Charlotte’s LaMelo Ball, who had 27 points, 11 assists and 10 rebounds.Giannis Antetokounmpo had 34 points and 18 rebounds to help the Bucks avenge one of their most embarrassing losses of the season.

I just know I have to stay ready and have to be loose.”In a game that featured 11 ties and 17 lead changes, Middleton helped Milwaukee gain command. He scored 11 points during a 14-3 spurt late in the third quarter that helped the Bucks take a 97-90 lead into the final period. “He got going when they kind of took control of the game,” Hornets coach Steve Clifford said.

But Plumlee missed the ensuing free throw, and the Bucks put it away from there.“Their record doesn’t give them justice,” Antetokounmpo said. “They’re a really good team. Or maybe they just play well against us. I don’t know.”Terry Rozier scored 20 points, Gordon Hayward 16, Jalen McDaniels 15 and P.J. Washington and Plumlee 14 each for Charlotte.
