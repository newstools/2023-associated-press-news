SYDNEY (AP) — Olympic 800-meter finalist Peter Bol on Tuesday said his provisional doping suspension has been lifted after the A and B samples didn’t match. Usually testing of the B sample confirms a doping infringement. “I was just informed that my B sample did not match my A sample,” Bol posted on Twitter. “My provisional suspension has been lifted by Sport Integrity Australia.”Bol said he’s never taken banned performance-enhancing substances and he described the last month as a “nightmare.” Athletics Australia announced last month that Bol had failed an out-of-competition test on Oct. 11. The 28-year-old runner’s A sample tested positive to the banned drug erythropoietin, known as EPO.“The relief I am feeling is hard to describe.” he said. “The last month has been nothing less than a nightmare. I wish that the results of my A sample had not been leaked, but there is nothing I can do about that.ADVERTISEMENT“To say it one more time: I am innocent and have not taken this substance as I was accused.”Bol placed fourth in the 800-meter final at the Tokyo Olympics and was a silver medalist at the 2022 Commonwealth Games.___More AP sports: https://apnews.com/hub/sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports
