SANTA FE. N.M. (AP) — Production is expected to resume this spring on the movie “Rust” that was halted in October 2021 after a fatal shooting on the set involving actor-producer Alec Baldwin.Rust Movie Productions also announced Tuesday that a related documentary will detail the completion of the film and the life of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins, who died shortly after being wounded during rehearsals at a ranch on the outskirts of Santa Fe.Baldwin and Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, the weapons supervisor on the set of the Western, were charged last month with felony involuntary manslaughter in Hutchins’ shooting death.Authorities said Baldwin was pointing a pistol at Hutchins when the gun went off, killing her and wounding director Joel Souza. Hutchins’ parents and sister have filed a lawsuit over the shooting after a similar suit filed by her husband and son was settled. Rust Movie Productions said Hutchins’ widower, Matthew Hutchins, will serve as the film’s new executive producer with Blanca Cline as the new cinematographer. Souza will return as director when production resumes although it’s unclear in what state the filming will take place.Rust Movie Productions officials said the use of “working weapons” and “any form of ammunition” will be prohibited on the movie set.
