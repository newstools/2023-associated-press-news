Clarke had seven of the team’s 11 rebounds in the key fourth.“This was an important game to go get because we kind of battled back in that fourth quarter,” Memphis coach Taylor Jenkins said.Unlike recent losses when Memphis couldn’t close out games, the Grizzlies were solid down the stretch, outscoring the Bulls 32-14 in the fourth — including a 10-0 run.“These recent games we’ve been giving up too many layups and stuff at the rim. Second-chance points,” Morant said. “We were back to pretty much our defense late and able to execute on the other end.”ADVERTISEMENTNikola Vucevic had 28 points and 17 rebounds for the Bulls, whose three-game winning streak ended.

I think we lost a little bit of rhythm.”The Bulls trailed 49-39 at halftime, plagued by 13 turnovers and 30% shooting, including 3 of 16 from 3-point range. But Chicago got rolling in the third behind Vucevic, who had 14 points in the quarter, and LaVine, who contributed 12. The Bulls led 75-72 entering the fourth.“I think execution-wise, we came down and weren’t really organized,” LaVine said. “We had a lot of opportunities to make shots. We just didn’t knock them down.“It was a low-scoring game on both ends. We just didn’t get enough stops.”For Memphis, it was a reprieve from its recent troubles where it had lost eight of the last nine. But Jackson said it is a matter of maintaining a balanced mindset through the slumps.ADVERTISEMENT“There is no time to get excited or feel bad about a win or a loss,” Jackson said. “The greatest teams never did that.
