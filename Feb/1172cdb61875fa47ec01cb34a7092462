It was the Brumbies’ 10th consecutive win over the Waratahs.Center David Havili scored the first try of the season in the 20th minute and the conversion which followed a penalty by Richie Mo’unga gave the Crusaders a 10-0 lead in front of a large home crowd at Christchurch.The Chiefs were able to stay in a mostly scrappy match and had cut the lead to 10-7 at halftime with a try to lock Brodie Retallick.Second-half tries to captain Sam Cane, center Alex Nankivell and replacement Cortez Ratima put the Chiefs ahead 31-10 after 70 minutes while the Crusaders mostly were locked in their own half or contained by the Chiefs’ defense.ADVERTISEMENTNew rules applied this season to speed up the game produced a faster game, though often at the expense of structure and the Chiefs probably adapted more quickly than the Crusaders.Pressure to use the ball quickly from rucks probably helped the more spontaneous Chiefs more than the Crusaders, who were forced to make a large number of tackles in the second half and missed too many as they were outscored 24-0.RugbyGalthié backs France to rebounce against Scots in 6 NationsGareth Edwards' Barbarians jersey sells for world record feeInjured Ringrose withdraws from Ireland before Italy gameFrance recall Haouas and Scotland summon Watson in 6 Nations“I thought we hung in there really well in the first half when we put ourselves under a bit of pressure,” Cane said. “I thought in the second half we got a lot of that right.“A lot of belief in this team.
