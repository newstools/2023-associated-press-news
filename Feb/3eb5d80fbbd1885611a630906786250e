PATTAYA, Thailand (AP) — Jennifer Kupcho of the United States fired a bogey-free 7-under 65 to share the lead alongside four other golfers after the opening round of the LPGA Thailand on Thursday.The crowded leaderboard was no surprise on the Pattaya Old Course: The average winning score over the past 10 years is 21 under par.Kupcho’s round was highlighted by a birdie-birdie finish and an eagle on the par-5 10th hole at Siam Country Club.Of her eagle, she said, “I hit a really good drive and had a pretty short club in. Still hybrid but pretty perfect club, and it hit just short of the green and rolled up really close to a tap-in.”With her in the lead were 2014 champion Anna Nordquist of Sweden, six-time USLPGA Tour winner Nasa Hataoko of Japan, local hope and tour rookie Jaravee Boonchant, and last year’s runner-up, Lin Xiyu of China.Three-time major winner Nordquist birdied her first hole, the 10th, and had eight in all against a lone bogey on the fourth.ADVERTISEMENTHataoka bogeyed the 13th but finished her round with four consecutive birdies.Boonchant, who earned her tour card through Q-School last December, also started on the 10th and birdied her first two holes.
