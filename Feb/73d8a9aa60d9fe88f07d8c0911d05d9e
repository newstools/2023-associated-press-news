WACO, Texas (AP) — Baylor coach Scott Drew couldn’t even wait to get to the podium for his postgame session with reporters Monday night before expressing his excitement.“It’s a good night for the Baylor Bears,” Drew said.LJ Cryer helped make sure of that, scoring 26 points to lead ninth-ranked Baylor to a 79-65 win over West Virginia. Coupled with No. 6 Texas’ 74-67 loss to Texas Tech, the victory lifted the Bears into a tie for the Big 12 lead.Cryer was 8 for 11 from 3-point range to lead the Bears (20-6, 9-4 Big 12), who have won four straight games and 10 of their last 11 after an 0-3 start in the conference.“The ball felt real good coming off my hand,” Cryer said. “I got a lot of great looks, so credit to my teammates. When I get those looks, I feel like I’m going to knock it down every time. It went my way tonight.”Emmitt Matthews Jr. scored 17 points to lead West Virginia, which was 7 for 21 from beyond the arc.ADVERTISEMENTAdam Flagler added 13 points and Jalen Bridges had 12 for Baylor, which shot 51% from the floor and was 14 for 27 from 3-point range. Keyonte George led the Bears with nine rebounds and seven assists.“We didn’t let them do anything,” West Virginia coach Bob Huggins said. “They made tough shots.” College basketballPICK SIX: Impact transfers paying dividends at contendersMackinnon rallies Elon to 70-68 victory over HamptonTexas Tech holds off late push to beat No. 6 Texas 74-67Holmes powers No. 2 Indiana's rout of No. 13 Ohio StateIt was the Bears’ defense that allowed them to take control.West Virginia (15-11, 4-9) made seven field goals in a row to build an 18-11 lead with 11:38 to go in the first half, but was just 2 of 18 the rest of the half, including an 0 for 11 stretch that lasted 8:51.Baylor outscored West Virginia 19-6 during that span and carried a 36-29 lead into halftime.BIG PICTUREWest Virginia: The Mountaineers dropped their second straight despite winning the rebounding battle 29-25, including an 14-11 edge on the offensive end.

Tonight, it was LJ that was going. That’s the sign of a good team is when you have someone who’s hot, you don’t freeze him out and say it’s my turn. You feed the hot hand.”UP NEXTWest Virginia will begin a two-game homestand Saturday against Texas Tech.Baylor will open a two-game trip Saturday against No. 5 Kansas.___AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/hub/college-basketball and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25
