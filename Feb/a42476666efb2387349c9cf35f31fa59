LEEDS, England (AP) — Leeds and Manchester United condemned “completely unacceptable” chants by rival fans about tragedies involving both clubs during Sunday’s Premier League match at Elland Road. The Premier League also said it would treat the issue as a “matter of urgency.” The game, which United won 2-0, was marred by some Leeds fans goading United supporters with chants about the Munich air disaster on Feb. 6, 1958.

ADVERTISEMENT“The League is treating the issue of tragedy chanting as a priority and as a matter of urgency,” it said. The Munich crash resulted in the deaths of 23 people, including eight United players. Two Leeds fans were killed on the eve of its UEFA Cup semifinal match against Turkish team Galatasaray.___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports
