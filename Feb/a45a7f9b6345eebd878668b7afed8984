The Hawks sent five second-round draft picks to the Warriors in the trade.Also, the Hawks traded Justin Holiday, Frank Kaminsky and two second-round picks to Houston for Garrison Matthews and Bruno Fernando. The 6-foot-9 Fernando began his career in Atlanta in the 2019-20 season.The 6-foot-7 Bey is averaging 14.8 points and 4.7 rebounds in his third season with the Pistons, and averaged a career-high 16.1 points last season.ADVERTISEMENTThe addition of Bey creates an apparent surplus of small forwards in Atlanta, where De’Andre Hunter is the starter.Atlanta was eighth in the Eastern Conference playoff standings before Thursday night’s home game against Phoenix.___AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports
