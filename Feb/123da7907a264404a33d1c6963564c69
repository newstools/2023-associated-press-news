MILAN (AP) — World Cup winner Lautaro Martínez continued his roaring start to the year as he set Inter Milan on its way to a 1-0 victory over AC Milan in the Derby della Madonnina on Sunday.Martínez has been in fantastic form since helping Argentina win the World Cup in December and he netted his seventh goal in his last eight matches as Inter consolidated second spot in Serie A with a second win over its fierce rival in less than three weeks.“As soon as the World Cup was over I said that winning it had fired me up,” Martínez said. “It’s the best present that I have ever received, I learnt a lot and I’m trying to put all that on the field.”It was Martínez’s 12th league goal of the season, putting him four behind leading Serie A goalscorer Victor Osimhen, who scored another two on Sunday to help runaway leader Napoli win 3-0 at lowly Spezia.Inter is 13 points behind Napoli and three points above third-place Roma. It is five points above Lazio, Atalanta and Milan, which has slipped to sixth after a woeful start to the year.ADVERTISEMENT“I complimented my players because they were perfect, I don’t remember a derby won and dominated in this way,” Inter coach Simone Inzaghi said. “We had a really great derby, winning two derbies in the space of 20 days isn’t something that happens every year. We’re not looking either ahead of us or behind us in the standings, but just at ourselves.”SoccerGerman women's soccer shows more investment as crowds growMan City accused of misleading Premier League over financesVinícius Júnior again targeted by racist insults in SpainStruggling Hoffenheim fires André Breitenreiter as coachMilan’s winless run extended to seven matches.
