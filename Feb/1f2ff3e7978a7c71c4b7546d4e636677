The former interim CEO of the U.S. Center for SafeSport has been temporarily suspended by the center he used to run for failure to report a case. The center posted the suspension for Regis Becker earlier this week. It also included a charge of abuse of process. Becker served as a member of the center’s board of directors when it opened in 2017, then took over as interim CEO and ran the organization for about six months at the start of 2019.The center’s disciplinary database had “probation” and “education” listed under the “additional details” column regarding Becker’s case. It said his case was subject to appeal and not yet final.Becker did not respond to a text sent by The Associated Press to a cell phone listed under his name.Center spokesman Dan Hill said the center would not comment on the case specifically.“We aim to handle every allegation with the same level of professionalism, objectivity and fairness,” Hill said. “Since opening its doors in 2017, the center has demonstrated a track record of holding participants accountable for misconduct, irrespective of their prominence, position or perceived importance to a sport.”ADVERTISEMENTBefore coming to the center, Becker served as an FBI special agent, then went to Penn State to launch the school’s ethics and compliance program in the aftermath of the sex-abuse scandal that led to the imprisonment of longtime assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky.Winter OlympicsAustralian governments agree funding split for 2032 OlympicsShiffrin remembers her late father at gold-medal ceremonyOlympics in 2018 showed glimpses of future NHL starsSweden emerges as sudden front-runner to host 2030 OlympicsBecker was a longtime weightlifting coach and also served as a member of USA Weightlifting’s board of directors.
