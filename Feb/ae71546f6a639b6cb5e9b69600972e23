EAST LANSING, Mich. (AP) — Michigan State coach Tom Izzo gazed into the crowd, tears welling in his eyes, moments before his team played its first home game since a mass shooting on campus killed three students and hospitalized five students.“It was one of those moments where I just said, `I’m a lucky guy,‘” Izzo recalled as his voice cracked with emotion. “I said to myself, `I hope we can come through for you.’” The Spartans did.Tyson Walker shook off a slow start to score 23 points and lifted Michigan State to an 80-65 win over No. 17 Indiana on Tuesday night, eight days after a mass shooting ended lives, endangered others and frightened an entire community.“It was definitely a emotional,” Walker said. “Everybody was involved in some way because everybody’s on campus. So, it was definitely good to go out there and play well for everybody.”The Spartans (17-10, 9-7 Big Ten) surged into the lead late in the first half after Walker started making 3-pointers following an 0-for-4 start from the field and were ahead by double digits for much of the second half.ADVERTISEMENT“Izzo’s teams play great. They play hard,” Indiana coach Mike Woodson said. “They force you to play hard.
