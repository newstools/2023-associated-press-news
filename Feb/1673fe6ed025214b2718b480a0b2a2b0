Maine’s Democratic Gov. Janet Mills said poems “elevate our soul.” Here are a few that she has written over the years:“For My Granddaughter” (2016)Men running for officeBellow about the future,Punch the air, Wave their arms,Yell on the tv.While in the delivery room,It is the fist you notice first,The quiet fingerlets That cling to one anotherWith invisible strengthClutching their own new skin,forming a circleOnly she understands.Then the face, wrinkly,The little body,A sturdy belly, knees and feet in miniature.Eyes and earsReady to know Everything that is new,Everything that is.A brain ready To learn,A heart ready To love.That is your godWarming your own heart,That is your god holding your hand So tight,Never letting you Go.“Every governmentOught to have A Department of the Future,”Kurt Vonnegut said.And here, she is.Clenching all ourTomorrows.—“For Stan” (2015)There are things I have seen I cannot explain –ADVERTISEMENTThe way a child cries and laughs At things only it knows.The way autumn always bringsthe smell of fries and donuts, musty hay,the baying of old animals, the carnies and barkers,the crowd in the grandstand shouting with a single voice, the chill of a new wind.The way spring brings everything back we’veMainePoetic politician: Maine governor's skills include verseMaine blueberries vs. fly: US senator files bill to helpWild ducks found dead in Maine test positive for bird fluNJIT takes down Maine 65-50Sheltered all the long dark days—Grass in the field, water in the stream,hope in the heart.And the way a dying person sometimes has one last good day.Our friend Harry had one last good day.In deep coma, it was the end, they said,as they pulled the tubes,and he awoke with a smile.And when you and I went to say goodbye,He was having the best party, Telling such stories with hisFirefighter friends, his wife, his neighbors,Before he died.There are other things,Like red lights in the skyThat twice appeared when I was on An old road on a dark night.Like the music we heard at the lakeThat came from swift bats, tall trees,naked loons at dusk.Like the man lost three days in deep woods,given up for dead, whoWalked out, following the river To the trail.Like the time I found you, love,and two lives changed.Like you, when we came to say goodbye. Laughing like lightning,You knew us, you saw us, you held us,And thanked us, every one, knowing it was the end.And like me nowholding in my hands ADVERTISEMENTyour old smile,missing that music, looking,following the river to another trail.  —-“This Fussy Fatality” (from “Balancing Act: A Book of Poems by Ten Maine Women,” 1975)This fussy fatality I have found mustbelong to some god-like dog-day dreamerwho, falling under the frequency ofthe full moon, forgets us,blinded by forgeries of the past,his eyes two telescopes of time turned inward.Pink and scarlet of dusk’s purgatorialkeeps us in-and-out, flame-bent forpurposes priceless and unfathomed.We return from forms of perfect mindto under zero, acknowledging theconditions of the day,harboring in undergarments our warespreserved with secret sacrifice.Logic makes checker squares on all that’s touchedfeigning bravado from every face I see;yet from the crevice of all eyescome these spiralling scarlet circles,ADVERTISEMENTmad-apple crimson.—“So What” (from Island Journal, 2021)You are Miles Davisdisinterred, a Hamletof Hypothermia,Part Faberge cloud, One piece of sky, a little amputation of eagleHiding strong wide wings,wild offspring of Canada,queen of camouflage,perched like a coyotewaiting for dark. Cynical archangel,Singing soundless hymns to an ancient heart,what memories, fears, loves and retributions do you inspire?Something too long absent, someone saying“I have always known youAnd know you still,”eyes promising never to leave you.Your talons clutch a branch that is my former soul. I say, I am Kind of Bluelike that sea of yours.You smileAs if you have just Devoured a crowsomewhere In Labrador.So What
