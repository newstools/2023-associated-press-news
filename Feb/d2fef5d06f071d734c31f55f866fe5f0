ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) — Atlantic City’s casinos won $211.6 million from in-person gamblers in January, up 15.3% from a year ago.But only three of the nine casinos won more that way last month than they did in January 2019, before the coronavirus pandemic erupted.When revenue from internet gambling and sports betting is included, the casinos, horse tracks that take sports bets, and the online partners of both those types of businesses won $436.8 million, up 14.5% from a year ago.Casino executives say revenue figures from internet gambling and sports betting — most of which is done online — are misleading in that the revenue generated from those forms of gambling is not solely for the casinos to keep; they must share as much as 70% of it with third parties, including sports books and tech platforms.January is usually the weakest month for the city’s casinos, and this year’s relatively strong performance could augur well for a good full year in 2023, said Jane Bokunewicz, faculty director of the Lloyd Levenson Institute at Stockton University, which studies the Atlantic City gambling market.ADVERTISEMENT“Even considering only brick-and-mortar (revenue), Atlantic City’s casino operators have reason to be hopeful,” she said.SportsTim McCarver, big league catcher and broadcaster, dies at 81Same ol' same ol': No progress for Black head coaches in NFLDurant cheered by fans, says Suns have 'all the pieces'Tiger Woods brings buzz to Riviera, Homa takes early leadIn-person gambling revenue, which the casinos consider their core business and most important economic indicator, surpassed the level of January 2020 just before the virus began spreading widely ($192.1 million).
