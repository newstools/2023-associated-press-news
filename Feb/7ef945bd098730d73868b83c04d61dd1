LONDON (AP) — TikTok said Friday that it’s planning two more European data centers, as the popular Chinese-owned video sharing app seeks to allay growing concerns about data privacy for its users in the West.TikTok has been under fire from European and American authorities over concerns that it could scoop up masses of user data and send it to China. The company’s general manager for European operations, Rich Waterworth, said in a blog post that it is “at an advanced stage of finalizing a plan” with a third-party provider for a second data center in Ireland. It announced its first center there last year. TikTok also is in talks to set up a third European data center, without specifying a location.“Regarding local data storage, in line with the growth of our community, we’re looking to expand our European data storage capacity,” Waterworth said. Data for European TikTok users will be migrated to the new centers starting this year, Waterworth said.
