ANNAPOLIS, Md. (AP) — A bipartisan group of Maryland lawmakers on Friday gathered to express their support for a package of legislation to modernize and improve access to mental health services in the state. The measures focus on getting people help earlier, preferably in community and primary care settings, before they experience a mental health crisis requiring costly trips to the emergency room or in-patient care.“Today we are here saying in this post-pandemic period we are going to do what it takes in Maryland to create a world-class mental health system,” Senate President Bill Ferguson, a Baltimore Democrat, said at a news conference with senators from both parties.Sen. Steve Hershey, the Senate minority leader, said state officials need to help Maryland’s community of behavioral health care providers.“We as legislators can help by providing policies that allow and encourage flexibility and innovation in meeting the needs of kids, adults and our seniors, and by seeking the financial resources to ensure that a qualified workforce stands ready to do the work,” Hershey, an Eastern Shore Republican, said.ADVERTISEMENTThe Maryland Senate already has passed a measure setting aside $12 million in 2025 to fund the 988 suicide and crisis prevention hotline. The bill is now in the House. The state health department designated 988 as Maryland’s behavioral health crisis hotline in July 2022.HealthFamily: Boy, 11, dies of infection after sprained ankleLawsuit: Mentally ill man froze to death in Alabama jailNorth Dakota moves to curb trans identity in data, minorsFetterman case highlights common stroke, depression linkEarlier this week, Democratic Gov.
