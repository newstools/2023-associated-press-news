EVANSTON, Ill. (AP) — Hunter Dickinson scored 19 points and Michigan pulled away in the second half to earn a 68-51 win on the road, completing a season sweep of Northwestern on Thursday night. The victory is just the second win away from home for the Wolverines this season and the first since they knocked off Minnesota in their Big Ten Conference opener December 8 in Minneapolis. Brooks Barnhizer’s jumper with four seconds left in the first half pulled Northwestern within a point at intermission, 26-25.

Michigan (12-10, 6-5) responded with 12 straight points — Joey Baker had a four-point play and a jumper in the run — for a 38-29 lead with 15:09 left. Dickinson dunked, was fouled and added the free throw and Terrance Williams II knocked down a 3-pointer to push the Wolverines’ lead into double digits and the Wildcats never got within 10 points again.
