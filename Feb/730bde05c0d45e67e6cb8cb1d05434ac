The court document said he is also wanted for hacking the Snapchat account of an unidentified public figure whom he allegedly tried to extort with the threat of publishing nude photographs of the person.ADVERTISEMENTHe is also wanted for several cases of “swatting,” prank calls to emergency services aimed at getting large numbers of police to be sent to different locations.The court rejected arguments by O’Connor’s lawyers that he should be tried in Spain since the servers he used were located there.The statement said he is wanted by courts in the Northern District of California and the Southern District of New York.
