ATHENS, Ga. (AP) — Georgia linebacker Jamon Dumas-Johnson, the second-leading tackler for 2022 national champions, was arrested Wednesday on charges of reckless driving and racing.According to Athens-Clarke County jail records, Dumas-Johnson was released Wednesday evening after posting a combined bond of $4,000 — $2,500 for allegedly racing on highways/streets and $1,500 for alleged reckless driving.The arrest on the misdemeanor charges followed an incident in Athens on Jan. 10, one day after the Bulldogs beat TCU 65-7 in the national championship game and Dumas-Johnson had four tackles. Georgia said in a statement that the “alleged conduct” by Dumas-Johnson “does not reflect our program’s values or the high standards we have established.” “As this is an open matter involving a student, we are not able to provide any additional information at this time and will continue to cooperate fully with law enforcement,” the statement added.
