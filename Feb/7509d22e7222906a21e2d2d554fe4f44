The 76ers also blew a 21-point lead in a 119-109 loss to Orlando on Monday.“It’s never easy,” Embiid said. “A 20-point lead in the NBA, that’s nothing. Any team can come back and that’s what they did tonight.” ADVERTISEMENTPhiladelphia went ahead by 21 points in the first quarter, but the Knicks continued to chip away and cut it to 53-51 at halftime.

The same thing happened in Orlando. Both times, we were scoring too easy. The second group comes in and thinks this is an offensive game and they didn’t see the reason the first group got the lead was because of defense.” The 76ers pulled within three, but Randle’s floater made it 102-92 with 2:18 remaining. Philadelphia never got closer than eight the rest of the way. “It was a great team win all-around,” Knicks coach Tom Thibodeau said. “It was great.
