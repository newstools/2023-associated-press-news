CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) — Teenage wicketkeeper-batter Richa Ghosh guided India to a second victory in two games at the Women’s T20 World Cup on Wednesday as her mature finishing overshadowed the return of star Smriti Mandhana.Opener Mandhana, who became the most expensive player at this week’s Women’s Premier League auction, was out for 10 on her comeback from a finger injury as India chased the West Indies’ modest 118-6 at Newlands in Cape Town.India was 43-3 in the eighth over when the 19-year-old Ghosh arrived at the crease, and she stroked five fours and constructed a 72-run stand with captain Harmanpreet Kaur (33) to take their team home.Kaur was out just before the end, leaving Ghosh to smack a short ball through square leg for four for the winning runs.India went level with England at the top of Group 2, with the English in first place on net run rate.They will meet in a top-of-the table match on Saturday, the highest profile game at the tournament so far.ADVERTISEMENTIndia beat Pakistan in its opening game, when Ghosh also showed her value with 31 not out to help seal victory.“She (Ghosh) has been great for us,” Kaur said. “She is someone who can always pull the game for us. She is a very dangerous batter. She can express herself. We are happy with the results and the next game is very important. (We) just want to continue the rhythm.”CricketHope, Powell new captains of West Indies limited-overs teamsIhsanullah's 5-12 earns Multan big win over Quetta in PSLBazball goes home as England takes on Kiwis in New ZealandPeshawar records thrilling 2-run win over Karachi in PSLA partnership of 73 for the second wicket between Stafanie Taylor and Shemaine Campbelle (30) threatened to set West Indies up for a good total but the late-innings acceleration never came.India spinner Deepti Sharma claimed both their wickets in her 3-15 and West Indies struggled from a good position at 77-1 to a below-par total.Pakistan played Ireland in Wednesday’s late game in Cape Town.___More AP cricket: https://apnews.com/hub/cricket and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports
