WAILUKU, Hawaii (AP) — A firefighter who was swept into a storm drain while responding to a storm on the Hawaiian island of Maui died over the weekend, officials said. Treʻ Evans-Dumaran, 24, died Saturday, according to a Maui County news release. He was in critical condition in the intensive care unit at Maui Memorial Medical Center after he was swept into a storm drain during heavy rain in Wailuku on Jan. 27. He was carried the length of eight football fields until he was found where the drain ended near the shoreline. A week ago, county officials said Evans-Dumaran, who was with the Maui Fire Department for three years, was “slowing making positive and promising signs of progress.” But his family confirmed he died Saturday morning, the county said. The county released a statement from his mother, Chelsie Evans, thanking the community for an “outpouring of love.” As of Monday, a GoFundMe page for the firefighter raised more than $136,000.
