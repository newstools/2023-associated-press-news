They were likely trapped, Özat said.At least two other Hatayspor players had to be pulled out of rubble but were now safe, Özat said. Atsu and Savut were the only two Hatayspor players or officials still unaccounted for, he added.The 31-year-old Atsu joined Hatayspor, which is based in the southern city of Antakya, last year after a spell playing in Saudi Arabia.The 7.8 magnitude earthquake rocked large parts of Turkey and neighboring Syria in the pre-dawn hours of Monday.ADVERTISEMENTThe quake was centered in Turkey’s southeastern province of Kahramanmaras, and was felt as far away as Cairo in Egypt.
