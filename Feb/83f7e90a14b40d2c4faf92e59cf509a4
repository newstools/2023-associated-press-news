KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) — Ugandan authorities say they will not renew the mandate of the United Nations human rights office in the East African country, effectively blocking the group’s operations at a time of heightened concerns over rights abuses. In a Feb. 3 notice to the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights in Uganda’s capital Kampala, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs asserted that local authorities have “the capacity to monitor the promotion and protection of human rights throughout the country.”From now on Uganda’s government will deal directly with the Geneva headquarters of the U.N. rights office, stated the letter that has been seen by The Associated Press. Ugandan officials confirmed the letter is authentic. Nicholas Opiyo, a prominent rights attorney in Uganda, described the decision as “unfortunate,” saying in a Twitter post that he hoped it was just a misunderstanding that could be resolved.
