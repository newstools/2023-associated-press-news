NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — The Vanderbilt Commodores and coach Jerry Stackhouse finally experienced the thrill of a big upset inside the Southeastern Conference’s oldest gym.

Tyrin Lawrence knocked down a 3-pointer from the right corner at the buzzer as the Commodores snapped an 11-game skid against their in-state rival by upsetting sixth-ranked Tennessee 66-65 Wednesday night.

POLL IMPLICATIONS
The road is turning into a challenging issue for the Volunteers with a second straight loss away from home, and this won’t help them stay in the Top 10. Two words… Memorial Magic💫@VandyMBB @jerrystackhouse pic.twitter.com/bPbZwqJXSk&mdash; Coach Jovan Haye (@jovanhaye) February 9, 2023DID IT COUNT?Stackhouse tapped a play used by Dwane Casey when the Vandy coach worked with him in the NBA in Toronto. Stackhouse added some wrinkles with Manjon driving toward the basket where the Vols collapsed on him before whipping the pass down the baseline to Lawrence. While everyone celebrated the shot, Stackhouse asked the scorekeeper if it counted. They didn’t know.“Then (official) Tony Greene came over and he said it was good. ‘We’re gonna look at it, but it was good.’ I can’t contain myself. I hugged Tony Greene,” Stackhouse said with a big smile.
