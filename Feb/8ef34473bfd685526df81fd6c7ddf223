WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — New Zealand authorities expect to make the final rescues Wednesday after a cyclone brought extensive flooding and landslides that claimed at least four lives.Cyclone Gabrielle struck the country’s north on Monday and has brought more destruction to this nation of 5 million than any weather event in decades.Police said at least four people had been confirmed killed by the storm, including a child caught in rising water on Tuesday at Eskdale on Hawke’s Bay.

Her visit to New Zealand was scheduled before the cyclone struck.“My thoughts are with all New Zealanders whose homes or livelihoods have been affected by Cyclone Gabrielle,” she said in a statement.“I admire the courage of the people of Aotearoa during this alarming and difficult time,” she said, using the country’s Māori-language name.ADVERTISEMENT“You should all be proud of the resilience, strength and care for your communities you are showing in the face of adversity,” she added.Around 9,000 people have been forced from their homes since Monday, with several communities isolated by floodwaters and landslides, he said.“Everyone knows we have a long path ahead of us as we deal with extensive damage to homes, businesses, roads and bridges and other fundamental parts of our infrastructure,” McAnulty said. “This is a significant disaster and it is going to take many weeks for those areas most affected to recover,” he added.Auckland was swamped two weeks ago by a record-breaking storm that also killed four people.A national emergency was declared Tuesday, enabling the government to support affected regions and provide additional resources. It is only the third national emergency ever declared.
