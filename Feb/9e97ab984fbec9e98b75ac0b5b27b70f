SYDNEY (AP) — Veteran opener David Warner has been ruled out of Australia’s remaining two test matches in India after injuring his elbow and sustaining a concussion in the second cricket test in New Delhi. Warner was substituted out of the match after the first innings and replaced by Matt Renshaw. Australia slumped to a six-wicket loss following a dramatic second-innings batting collapse as India took a 2-0 series lead and retained the Border-Gavaskar Trophy. Cricket Australia issued a statement Tuesday saying Warner will return to Sydney for rest and recovery but is expected to return to India next month for the three-game limited-overs series. Australia is struggling with form and injury problems in India. Injured pace bowler Josh Hazlewood also returned to Australia, without playing a test, after the loss in New Delhi. Skipper Pat Cummins was making a quick return to Sydney because of a serious family illness but was scheduled to be back in India ahead of the third test starting March 1 at Indore.ADVERTISEMENTThe 36-year-old Warner had been struggling on the slow, up-and-down pitches in India, scoring 1 and 10 in Australia’s big series-opening loss in Nagpur and 15 in the second test, when he was hit on the elbow trying to fend away a short ball and also hit on the batting helmet. ___More AP cricket: https://apnews.com/hub/cricket and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports
