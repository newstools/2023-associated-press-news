Lauren Schwartz made two foul shots before Ladine put the Huskies in front with a layup with 1:40 left.“We always play like it’s 0-0, always,” Daniels said. “We’ve just got to keep on playing together, and I think this game, we emphasized defense.

We knew if we kept putting in the work, eventually we were going to get what we deserve.”Daniels had 15 points in Washington’s first victory over a ranked opponent since a 74-68 win over UCLA on Feb. 23, 2020.
