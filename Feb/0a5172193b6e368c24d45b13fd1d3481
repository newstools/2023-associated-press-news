RICHMOND, Va. (AP) — A top Virginia Department of Health official has been tapped to lead agency operations for now, after Senate Democrats effectively ousted the former health commissioner, Dr. Colin Greene. Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s administration has asked VDH chief operating officer Christopher Lindsay to handle the day-to-day operations at the agency, a Youngkin spokeswoman said in a statement Monday. “In his brief time with the Department, COO Lindsay has demonstrated his ability to manage a complex organization like VDH and has developed relationships in both the central and district offices,” spokeswoman Macaulay Porter said. Meanwhile, the governor’s office is working on compiling a list of potential replacements for Greene, Porter said. State law says the commissioner must be a physician. Lindsay has a background in health care administration and joined the department in November, according to his official biography. News of his role was first reported by The Washington Post.
