ISLAMABAD (AP) — Security forces acting on intelligence raided a hideout of Pakistani Taliban insurgents along the border with Afghanistan, triggering an intense shootout that left 12 militants dead, the country’s military said Wednesday. The pre-dawn raid came amid soaring tensions in Pakistan and in the aftermath of a mosque bombing last week that killed 101 people in Peshawar. Pakistani officials blamed the blast on the the outlawed Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan, or TTP, which denied involvement. Pakistani Taliban have a strong presence in Lakki Marwat, where they have launched multiple attacks in recent months. Overnight in the district in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, security forces launched the operation after monitoring the insurgents for a week, according to a military statement.“Terrorists were lured in by providing a vehicle for escape that was intercepted and neutralized,” it said. The military said troops also recorded a case of weapons, munition and Afghan currency.ADVERTISEMENTThere was no immediate comment from TTP.The overnight operation against TTP was the first major confrontation since November, when the militant group halted a monthslong ceasefire with the government and resumed attacks on troops and police across the country.AfghanistanMedia watchdog urges release of journalist detained in KabulBomb kills soldier, wounds 11 people in southwest PakistanPervez Musharraf, Pakistan martial ruler in 9/11 wars, diesPakistani troops kill 2 militants in raid near Afghan borderThe TTP, which maintains sanctuaries in neighboring Afghanistan, is separate from but a close ally of the Afghan Taliban.
