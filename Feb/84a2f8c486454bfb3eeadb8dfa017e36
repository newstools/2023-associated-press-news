The deputies also did not notify dispatch or their supervisor, the reports showed. Watkins also did not report on his daily log that he went to the arrest location, according to the reports. Bonner said the sheriff’s office does not believe that the deputies will face criminal charges.Bowers and Watkins have been Shelby County deputies since June 2021, Bonner said. Both suspensions began Wednesday.
