He started out at the bottom in the film room and it was pretty apparent very quickly that he understood everything that we coaches wanted,” Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said.ADVERTISEMENTSo, the mentor is not the least surprised at Hardy’s early success with the the Jazz, who were widely predicted to be one of the league’s worst teams this year. “I slowly fell in love with the guy. … He’s got a great temperament, much better than mine. I actually learned from him in a lot of those (tense) situations as much or more than he learned from me,” Popovich said.TIP-INSSpurs: Sochan and Dunn pushed each other after the Spur forward was fouled going to the basket in the second quarter.
