He then pulled out a paper bag with the feces and smeared her face with the contents.ADVERTISEMENT“I would like to apologize sincerely to all concerned, first and foremost to Ms. Huester, for my absolutely unacceptable act,” Goecke said in a written statement. “In retrospect, I am clearly aware that this was a disgraceful act in the heat of the moment and an overreaction,” he added.EntertainmentIn which Winnie the Pooh stars in an R-rated slasher movieThom Browne channels ‘Little Prince’ in heartfelt NYFW showProduction to resume on movie 'Rust' after fatal shootingActors strike at California medieval-themed dinner theaterHowever, he added that it’s time for media to “rethink a certain form of destructive and hurtful reporting that damages the whole cultural sector” and criticized Huester for what he said were “often nasty reviews.”Goecke pointed to the “nervous strain” resulting from two premieres in quick succession as a reason for his actions.“I apologize for the fact that I finally blew my top, but I also ask for a certain understanding at least for the reasons why this happened,” he wrote.Huester filed a criminal complaint after the incident.
