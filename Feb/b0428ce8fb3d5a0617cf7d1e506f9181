No other Kansas player had more than 8 points.“It’s not a formula for success for us,” Jayhawks coach Bill Self said. “We need balance from our starting five. If one guy feels like he’s got to go do it all on his own, it crashes the offense.”The Cyclones led for all but 1:14 of the game, building a 34-16 scoring edge in the paint. Kansas struggled early, making just two of their first 10 shots and committing 11 turnovers in the first 20 minutes.ADVERTISEMENTIowa State shot 46% for the game.“From the beginning, we gave them some easy buckets,” Wilson said. “That’s something we’ve struggled with (defensively) ... the easiest way to get comfortable is easy buckets, layups, stuff like that.”Iowa State was up 33-21 at the break.
