Here’s a look at some of the major proposals in the spending plan:— $2.6 billion in additional funding for K-12 public schools.— 10% tax cut for single people earning up to $100,000 and couples earning up to $150,000.— $290 million to cover repairs and renovations at American Family Field.

The state Department of Transportation would be required to automatically register eligible citizens to vote with their information on file. Local clerks would be allowed to start tallying absentee ballots the day before an election, and people would only have to live in a municipality for 10 days — instead of the current 28-day minimum — to vote there.PoliticsCBO projects higher unemployment, slow exit from inflationRep.
