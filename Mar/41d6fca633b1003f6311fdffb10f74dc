After signing Derek Carr at quarterback, the next priorities become receiver and running back because of uncertainty at each position. The Saints will have to either cut top receiver Michael Thomas or renegotiate his pay because of his current contractâ€™s heavy salary cap burden. Meanwhile, top running back Alvin Kamara faces a potential suspension in connection with a criminal court case in Las Vegas. Kamara is accused of beating of a man in a casino hotel during the weekend of the 2022 Pro Bowl. Defensively, the Saints ranked fifth in yards allowed, but have several key regulars on the defensive line with expiring contracts.AVAILABLE SALARY CAP SPACE (approximately): $25 million over the cap. ___ AP NFL coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL
