Australia was penalized in the subsequent ruck and New Zealand captain Sarah Hirini reacted, taking a quick tap to score.Australia replied immediately through Madison Ashby who took the ball on the left side, propped and stepped past two defenders on her way to the line.Hirini’s offload created a try for Stacey Waaka which gave New Zealand a 14-7 lead at halftime.Miller made up for her early mistake to score New Zealand’s third try and make their lead 19-7 after two minutes of the second half.Australia rallied again with a try to Charlotte Caslick which made the score 19-12 and gave her team a chance with three minutes remaining. But New Zealand was able to control the late possession and hold for the win.ADVERTISEMENT“We came here wanting to tick off qualifying for the Olympics and doing that and bringing a trophy back to New Zealand is really exciting,” Hirini said.While Argentina was aiming for its second title of the season in the men’s final, France was playing in its first final in this year’s series and seeking its first title since 2005.France had an overwhelming share of possession throughout the match and attacked methodically by building phases.
