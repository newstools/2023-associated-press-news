Leonard had 17 points in the first half, but saved his best play for the fourth quarter with a thunderous dunk over Jakob Poeltl to make it 100-85 with 5:17 remaining.The Raptors responded with an 15-4 surge to get to 104-100 in the final minute before Zubac’s dunk pushed it back to six.“I thought early in the game we were playing too fast and giving up the ball too early. After the first quarter we slowed down, tried to attack the paint and made passes with precision,” Leonard said.

The Clippers got to the line 31 times and made 24.VanVleet tired to suppress his disappointment, but then ended up going off on referee Ben Taylor after the game.“I don’t mind it. I’ll take the fire. I don’t really care. I though Ben Taylor was (bleeping) terrible tonight,” he said. “You can look up most of my techs (technical fouls) this year have been with him officiating. So at a certain point as a player you feel it is personal. That’s not why we lost tonight. We got outplayed, but it definitely makes it tougher to overcome.”TIP-INSRaptors: Largest lead was 10 at 25-15 late in the first quarter. ...
