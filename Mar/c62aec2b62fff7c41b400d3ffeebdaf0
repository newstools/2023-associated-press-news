Berka also wrote, “I’ll kill anyone who tries to take my guns,” according to the FBI.He appeared in court to hear the charge and was returned to jail to await a March 15 detention hearing. The federal defender office, which is representing Berka, declined to comment.Berka was involuntarily committed for mental health care in 2012 and declared incapacitated, which bars him from possessing guns or ammunition, the FBI said.ADVERTISEMENTHis mother purchased four firearms for him in the past year, but now believes he “should be arrested and put in prison,” the FBI said in the complaint.She “does not think the mental health treatment is working,” the FBI said.PoliticsHouse votes to declassify info about origins of COVID-19DeSantis visits Iowa as interest in likely Trump rival risesBiden, EU leader hold talks on proposal on electric vehiclesIn rift with Biden, Manchin vows to block oil, gas nomineeU.S. Attorney Dawn Ison gave credit to Google for notifying federal authorities about the threats on YouTube.“We hope members of the community will, likewise, pay attention and report such conduct to law enforcement,” she said.The case follows the February arrest of another Michigan man who was accused of threatening to kill state government officials who are Jewish.
