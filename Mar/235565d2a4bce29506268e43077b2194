KENNESAW, Ga. (AP) — Terrell Burden scored 19 points and made a free throw with less than a second left to rally Kennesaw State to a 67-66 victory over Liberty on Sunday, earning the Owls their first Atlantic Sun Conference championship and their first trip to the NCAA Tournament.It is a remarkable turnaround for Kennesaw State under fourth-year coach Amir Abdur-Rahim. The Owls finished with a 1-28 record in 2019-20 — Burden’s freshman season and the first under Abdur-Rahim. They went 5-19 in Abdur-Rahim’s second season and 13-18 last year. Now the Owls will bring a school-record 26-8 mark to their first Big Dance.Kennesaw State can credit its victory to the defensive job it did on Liberty’s Darius McGhee, the ASUN player of the year and the conference’s all-time leading scorer. McGhee made just 6 of 21 shots from the floor and he was 0 for 11 from beyond the arc. McGhee came in averaging 22.7 points per game but finished with 14. Kyle Rode scored a career-high 23 points for the Flames (26-8). The senior made 9 of 14 shots with four 3-pointers.ADVERTISEMENTChris Youngblood hit all seven of his free throws and scored 16 for Kennesaw State.
