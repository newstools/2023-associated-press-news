ATLANTA (AP) — Jalen Carter’s next step in his attempts to preserve his status as a top prospect in next month’s NFL draft will be Georgia’s pro day on March 15, where he is expected to participate in workouts in front of coaches and general managers.Carter, a defensive tackle who played a big role in the Bulldogs’ back-to-back national championships, has been widely projected as one of the top picks in the April 27 NFL draft. His draft outlook was potentially clouded by misdemeanor charges of racing and reckless driving in relation to the Jan. 15 crash that killed teammate Devin Willock and a Georgia recruiting staffer, 24-year-old Chandler LeCroy.Police allege in an arrest warrant that Carter was racing his 2021 Jeep Trackhawk against the 2021 Ford Expedition driven by LeCroy at the time of the crash. Willock was a passenger in the SUV LeCroy was driving.Police determined LeCroy’s Expedition was traveling at about 104 mph (167 kph) shortly before the crash. The arrest warrant says LeCroy’s blood-alcohol concentration was .197 at the time of the crash. The legal limit in Georgia is .08.ADVERTISEMENTThe crash occurred just hours after the Bulldogs celebrated their second straight national championship with a parade and ceremony.College footballNCAA's proposed rule changes a good start, Kirby Smart saysPanthers weighing options as quarterback hunt continuesHall of Famer Ault among 3 joining CFP selection committeeUSC, Oklahoma, Seton Hall, Iowa in new San Diego tourneyCarter tweeted a statement on Wednesday, saying he expects to be “fully exonerated of any criminal wrongdoing.”He is scheduled for for arraignment in municipal court in Athens on April 18 after posting a $4,000 bond on the charges late Wednesday night.
