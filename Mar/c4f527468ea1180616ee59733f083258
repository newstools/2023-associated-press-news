Las Vegas owns the seventh pick in the draft and also could go there for its next QB. Beyond that position, the Raiders have needs throughout their defense and on the offensive line. How much they commit financially to a quarterback will determine how much the Raiders can adequately address the rest of the roster.AVAILABLE SALARY CAP SPACE (approximately): $39 million.___AP NFL coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL
