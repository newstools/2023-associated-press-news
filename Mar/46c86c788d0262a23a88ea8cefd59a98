LONDON (AP) — Manchester City kept up the pressure on Arsenal after Erling Haaland converted a second-half penalty to secure a 1-0 win over Crystal Palace on Saturday in the English Premier League.Haaland spurned a great chance in the first half but calmly converted from the spot in the 78th minute after Michael Olise clumsily clattered into Ilkay Gundogan in the area.The win brought City within two points of leader Arsenal ahead of the Gunners’ visit to Fulham on Sunday. Palace was still looking for a first victory of 2023.Haaland’s 28th goal in 27 league games came after a cleverly taken corner by City. With Palace players switching off, City played a short corner to Gundogan, who was wide open inside the area. Olise rushed in to challenge the midfielder, only to kick his leg as he tried to get to the ball.Until then, it looked like Palace manager Patrick Vieira — the former Arsenal captain who finished his playing career at City and started his coaching career at its sister club New York City FC — may do the Gunners a big favor in the title race between his two former clubs.But Palace again looked toothless in attack and finished without a single shot on target for the third league game in a row. ___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports
