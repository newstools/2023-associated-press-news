Alyssa Frescas-Durazo added 12.

Booker hit a jumper and the Rebels took a 52-49 lead into the fourth quarter.The lead got back up to 10 but a Tess Barnes 3 made it 61-55. Young then scored twice. Barnes made the Cowgirls 11th and last 3-pointer at the 2:29 mark to make it a seven-point game but Booker scored the final six points for UNLV.ADVERTISEMENT“These girls know how to win,” third-year coach Linda La Rocque said. “They knew it was winning time, they know how to get defensive stops, get every rebound and execute on the offensive end. There was no doubt in my mind.”Barnes scored 13 points for the Cowgirls (22-10), who were playing for their third NCAA berth. Emily Mellema and Grace Ellis both had 10. Leading scorer Allyson Fertig was held to half her average, scoring just seven as she battled foul trouble.Women's college basketballThe AP Top 25 Women's Basketball PollJoens sets Big 12 mark, Iowa St women top Texas Tech 72-56At New Mexico St, a meltdown that runs beyond basketballBalanced MTSU women cruise past North Texas 66-45Wyoming scored the first basket of the game but never led after that, trailing 31-28 at the half.
