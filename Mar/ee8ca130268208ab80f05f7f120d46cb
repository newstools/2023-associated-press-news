Michigan cornerback D.J. Turner II posted the fastest time in the 40-yard dash at this year’s NFL scouting combine and his 4.26-second performance is the fifth-fastest ever, regardless of position.Turner is projected as a second-round pick in the NFL draft next month. Also producing a top-five all-time performance at this year’s event was Illinois safety Jartavius Martin with a 44-inch vertical jump. While starring at the scouting combine can foreshadow NFL stardom like in the case of Deion Sanders, who blazed to a 4.27-second hand-clocked time in the 40-yard dash in 1989, superlative performances at what some call the “Underwear Olympics,” don’t necessarily foretell exemplary NFL careers. Some of the best performers in Indianapolis, such as Ohio State strongman Mike Kudla in 2006 or Missouri wide receiver Emanuel Hall in 2019, never heard their names called in the draft or appeared in an NFL game.ADVERTISEMENTWhile more nuanced indicators of a prospect’s potential and fit can be gleaned from position drills, game film, team visits, sit-down interviews and college pro days, standing out in one or more of the staple drills at the league’s annual gathering of franchises and their future stars can vault players up the draft board.NFLEx-Raider Derek Carr agrees to 4-year contract with SaintsAP source: Raiders place franchise tag on Josh JacobsSeahawks, QB Geno Smith reach agreement on 3-year dealVorhees, Brown lead position in bench press at NFL combineHere are the other top performances all-time at the NFL scouting combine and a look at how the players fared on the football field:40-YARD DASH4.22 seconds — John Ross III, WR, Washington, 2017.
