MIRPUR, Bangladesh (AP) — Bangladesh skipper Tamim Iqbal won the toss Friday and sent England in to bat in the second one-day cricket international. England won the opening game by three wickets to take an early lead in the three-game series. England made two changes with allrounder Sam Curran and fast bowler Saqib Mahmood replacing Chris Woakes and Jofra Archer. Mahmood is making his return to ODI cricket for the first time since 2021. Bangladesh remained unchanged as it bids to level the series. Bangladesh hasn’t lost a bilateral ODI series at home since its 2-1 defeat to England in 2016. ___Lineups:Bangladesh: Tamim Iqbal (captain), Liton Das, Najmul Hossain, Shakib Al Hasan, Mushfiqur Rahim, Mahmudullah, Afif Hossain, Mehidy Hasan, Taskin Ahmed, Taijul Islam, Mustafizur Rahman England: Jason Roy, Phil Salt, Dawid Malan, James Vince, Jos Buttler (captain), Will Jacks, Moeen Ali, Sam Curran, Adil Rashid, Saqib Mahmood, Mark Wood ___More AP cricket: https://apnews.com/hub/cricket and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports
