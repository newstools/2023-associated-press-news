NEW YORK (AP) — Regardless of Villanova’s seed or record, eliminating the Wildcats from the Big East Tournament will always be accomplishment to Creighton coach Greg McDermott.Ryan Kalkbrenner scored 21 points, Ryan Nembhard added 17 and No. 24 Creighton defeated Villanova 87-74 Thursday night in a rematch of last season’s tournament championship game.“This same team just dominated us a couple weeks ago in Philadelphia,” McDermott said. “Anytime we can beat Villanova it’s a great win for our program because of the respect that we had when Coach (Jay) Wright was there and we continue to have with (coach) Kyle (Neptune).”The third-seeded Bluejays (21-11) advanced to the semifinals Friday night at Madison Square Garden to face second-seeded and 15th-ranked Xavier. The top four seeds swept the quarterfinals.Nembhard made three of Creighton’s 12 3-pointers, including one from the corner off an offensive rebound that put the Bluejays up 18 with 12:54 left in the second half.ADVERTISEMENTLast season’s Big East freshman of the year missed the conference and NCAA tournaments in 2022 because of wrist injury.“Kind of feels like a stage when you get out there when the lights hit,” he said about playing in the Garden. “It’s great being out there.”SportsSuns' Durant out with ankle injury, re-evaluated in 3 weeksAP source: Doncic MRI shows no significant issues with thighPatrick Ewing fired by Georgetown; went 13-50 last 2 seasonsRamey grabs Players lead in his debut at golf's fickle testEric Dixon’s 3 for sixth-seeded Villanova (17-16) cut lead to 65-56 with 4:43 left and perked up the Wildcats fans at the Garden after a Creighton had dominated the second half.But Arthur Kaluma responded with a 3 after the Bluejays broke Nova’s press to bump the lead back to 12 on the next possession.

But you look at the first half, I thought defensively it actually wasn’t that bad. I thought they got out in transition a little bit too much.” Dixon scored 20 points to lead the Wildcats.The Bluejays took a 32-23 lead at half behind Kalbrenner’s 10 points and a personal nine-point run from Trey Alexander, who made three consecutive 3s.ADVERTISEMENTCreighton has played in the last two Big East finals and four overall since joining the conference in 2014 — but the Bluejays have yet to win a title.BIG PICTUREVillanova: Neptune’s first season as coach was derailed in part by injuries and absences. Fully loaded, the Wildcats found a groove late in the season, but they still lacked length and a natural point guard and Creighton exposed those deficiencies.“I’m going to have to take some time and go back and evaluate that and take a deep breath,” Neptune said about a whirlwind year. “I think the game right now is just a little too raw. I’ll go back and do some meditations and think about that when the season’s over.”Creighton: Baylor Scheierman scored seven points in 45 seconds early in the second half that opened up the lead to 16 and Villanova never really recovered.Scheierman hit a 3 from up top and was fouled by Dixon for what turned out to be a four-point play, and then made another 3 in transition to make it 44-28 with 16:34 left.ADVERTISEMENTScheierman, the South Dakota State transfer, finished with 12 points, 12 rebounds and nine assists.UP NEXTVillanova: The Wildcats, who were serenaded with chants of “NIT!” in the final seconds by the Bluejays fans, are in danger of missing the postseason completely for the first time since 2012.Creighton: The Bluejays split two meetings with Xavier in January.___AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/hub/college-basketball and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25
