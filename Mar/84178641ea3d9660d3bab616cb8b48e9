MILAN (AP) — Cremonese fought back from two goals down and fell short to a stoppage-time winner by Sassuolo for 3-2 in Serie A on Monday.After surprisingly beating Roma on Tuesday for its first league success of the season, Cremonese was hoping to achieve back-to-back wins in Serie A for the first time since 1996.That seemed unlikely when the visitor found itself 2-0 down by the break after Armand Laurienté fired in a free kick and set up Davide Frattesi with a delightful backheeled pass.But Davide Ballardini sent on Cyriel Dessers after the interval and he got Cremonese back into the match in the 62nd when he ran onto a poor header from Sassuolo defender Martin Erlić and fired into the bottom right corner.And Dessers appeared to have earned the visitors a precious point when he leveled seven minutes from time, running onto a long goal kick and rounding Sassuolo ’keeper Andrea Consigli before firing into the far bottom corner.ADVERTISEMENTHowever, it was another substitute who netted the winner when Nedim Bajrami scored in the second minute of added time following another assist by Laurienté.Cremonese remained nine points from safety. Sassuolo moved 12 points above the relegation zone.Bologna played at Torino late, hoping to boost its bid to qualify for Europe.___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports
