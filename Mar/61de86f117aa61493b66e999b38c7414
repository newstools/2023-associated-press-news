HALLANDALE BEACH, Fla. (AP) — Forte announced himself as a major Kentucky Derby contender on Saturday, the overwhelming favorite taking command in the stretch to win the Grade 2 Fountain of Youth at Gulfstream Park.Sent off at 1-2 odds, Forte finished 1 1/8 miles in 1 minute, 43.12 seconds and returned $3, $2.40 and $2.10 under jockey Irad Ortiz. He won by 4 1/2 lengths over Rocket Can, with Cyclone Mischief taking third.“Honestly, I can’t say I was surprised,” said winning trainer Todd Pletcher. “I felt really, really good the way this horse was coming into the race. It looks like there’s a lot of upside.”The win gives Forte 90 points in the Kentucky Derby qualifying standings, guaranteeing him a spot in the Run for the Roses on May 6 assuming the horse remains healthy.“It’s always been the dream,” said Mike Repole, part of the ownership of Forte along with Florida Panthers owner Vincent Viola. “Dream big, dream bigger. It’s a good feeling right now.”ADVERTISEMENTForte, last year’s Eclipse Award winner as the champion 2-year-old male, has now won five of his six career starts, including his last four — all of them either Grade 1 or Grade 2 events.Forte’s next start could be the Florida Derby on April 1, also at Gulfstream.SportsJa Morant says he'll get help after video shows apparent gunYoung's height, Richardson's workout all rage at NFL combineChase Elliott out of NASCAR indefinitely after tibia surgeryKitayama holds onto Bay Hill lead over Scheffler, Hovland“I think the race is going to set him up for future races well for sure,” Ortiz said. “I mean, he was ready today.
