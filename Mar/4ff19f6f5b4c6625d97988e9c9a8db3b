It’s understanding guys expect me to make plays. That’s what I’m here for. ... This is part of my maturation as an NBA player and as a point guard in this organization. I love that. I love that expectation for me.”Pacers coach Rick Carlisle spoke of his All-Star point guard’s growing affinity for making plays late.“He took over the game in overtime,” Carlisle said. “He certainly has demonstrated that is what he’s about. He loves those moments, very much the way (Hall of Famer) Reggie Miller loved those moments.”ADVERTISEMENTThe Pacers have won seven consecutive games against the Rockets, who have the NBA’s second-worst record at 15-51.“I will blame Buddy for not having 20 (assists),” Haliburton said with a smile, referring to Hield’s missed shot.The Rockets trailed for all of three quarters before rallying with a 15-2 run to take a 110-108 lead with 4:10 remaining.
