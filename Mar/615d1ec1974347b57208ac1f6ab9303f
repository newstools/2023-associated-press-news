If Rodgers decides to return to the Packers or retires, the Jets will have to scramble and turn their focus to Jimmy Garoppolo, set to become a free agent, or perhaps even Lamar Jackson, who received the non-exclusive franchise tag from Baltimore. After that, improving the offensive line is a priority with center and both tackle spots possible free-agent targets. The Jets need depth on the defensive line and at linebacker. They filled a big need by agreeing with Baltimore on a trade for safety Chuck Clark.AVAILABLE SALARY CAP SPACE (approximately): $1.5 million over the cap.___AP NFL coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL
