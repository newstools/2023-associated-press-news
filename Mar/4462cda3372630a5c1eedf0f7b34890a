NEW YORK (AP) â€” An own-goal in the first half gave New York City FC a 1-0 victory over Inter Miami at Yankee Stadium on Saturday night. Inter Miami (2-1-0) went into the day as one of just four undefeated teams in Major League Soccer.NYCFC, which had a loss and a draw in its first two matches of the season, got a goal in the 36th minute when Miami defender Christopher McVey tried to deflect an NYCFC free kick. Miami had shut out its opponents in the first two games. Only two teams have started the season with three clean sheets: The Sounders in 2009 and the Galaxy in 2010. Miami goalkeeper Drake Callender finished the match with seven saves. But the team was hurt in the 73rd minute when midfielder Gregore was injured and limped off the field. New York City knocked Miami out of the playoffs in the opening round last season. Both teams next play Saturday. Inter Miami travels to play Toronto, while NYCFC will entertain D.C.
