Chicago addressed a big need for a playmaker to help quarterback Justin Fields by acquiring star receiver D.J. Moore from Carolina along with the No. 9 and No. 61 overall picks in 2023, a first-rounder in 2024 and a second-rounder in 2025, the people said. With Fields running for 1,143 yards, the Bears led the league in rushing last season. But they finished at the bottom in passing. Chicago still has some big holes to fill after setting a franchise record for losses. The Bears desperately need help up front after finishing with a league-worst 20 sacks, their lowest total since the 2003 team had 18. Their sack leader was a safety — Jaquan Brisker with four — and no lineman had more than three. Chicago could also use help on the offensive line after Fields was sacked 55 times — tied with Denver’s Russell Wilson for the most in the NFL. AVAILABLE SALARY CAP SPACE (approximately): $75 million.___AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL
