PHOENIX (AP) — A knife-wielding man has been fatally shot by Phoenix police at a home where two women were found injured, according to authorities. Police said officers responded to a Laveen neighborhood about 6 p.m. Monday after receiving calls from children at the home about a domestic violence incident. Arriving officers reported seeing a woman with stab wounds and on her knees at the front door and her husband standing behind her with a knife in each hand. Police said 40-year-old Anthony Castro didn’t respond to multiple commands to drop the knives before he was shot. They said 40-year-old Monica Castro was taken to a hospital in critical condition and later died while the suspect’s grandmother was treated for injuries and released. Police said three children in the home — ages 9 to 14 — were unharmed in the incident after going up and down the street seeking help before authorities arrived.
