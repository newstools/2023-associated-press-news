With Smith taken care of, Seattle needs to come up with solutions at linebacker and decide if the desire for additional pass rush help should come via the draft or free agency. Starting LB Cody Barton is a free agent and fellow starter Jordyn Brooks will miss a chunk of next season recovering from ACL surgery. There’s been talk of a reunion with longtime franchise stalwart Bobby Wagner after his release by the Rams. The interior offensive and defensive lines are also likely to be a focus for Seattle, including the need for a starter at center after Austin Blythe’s retirement.AVAILABLE SALARY CAP SPACE (approximately): $24 million. ___ AP NFL coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL
