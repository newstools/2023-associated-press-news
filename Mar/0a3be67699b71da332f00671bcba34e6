Klein, DB Jaquan Johnson, S Dean Marlowe.RESTRICTED FREE AGENTS: LB Tyrel Dodson, CB Dane Jackson, DB Cam Lewis.NEEDS: More salary cap space. The Bills have to first start cutting players or restructuring salaries before they can even begin filling their numerous needs, which will include the likelihood of having to replace long-time defensive fixtures Edmunds and Poyer. Edmunds’ anticipated departure leaves a huge hole in the middle of Buffalo’s defense, while Poyer was part of a veteran defensive secondary that included starters Micah Hyde and Tre’Davious White. The Bills could use more experienced depth at receiver after Gabe Davis failed to establish himself at the No. 2 role opposite Stefon Diggs. Both lines are once again in transition, though Saffold and Phillips expressed interest in returning under relatively modest contracts.NFLPanthers wish list includes adding tight end, defensive endFuture of Lamar Jackson, Aaron Rodgers clouds free agencySean McVay says he's back for the long haul with LA RamsTexans need receivers, linebackers as free agency approachesAVAILABLE SALARY CAP SPACE (approximately): $20 million over the cap.___AP NFL coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL
