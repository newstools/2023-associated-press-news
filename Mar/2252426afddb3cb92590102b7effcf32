KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) — Kedrian Johnson had 20 points, Tre Mitchell added 17 points and nine rebounds, and No. 8 seed West Virginia rolled to a 78-62 victory over ninth-seeded Texas Tech in the opening round of the Big 12 Tournament on Wednesday night.Erik Stevenson added 18 points and Emmitt Matthews Jr. had 13 for the Mountaineers (19-13), who advanced to play third-ranked Kansas — the No. 1 seed and defending champion — in the quarterfinal round on Thursday.Pop Isaacs had 15 points for Texas Tech (16-16). Kevin Obanor and De’Vion Harmon scored 14 apiece.The Red Raiders were playing without coach Mark Adams, who was suspended Sunday for what the school called the “use of an inappropriate, unacceptable and racially insensitive comment.” Adams led the Red Raiders to the title game of last year’s Big 12 Tournament, where they lost to eventual national champ Kansas.Whether he returns to Texas Tech is unclear; even before his suspension, there had been talk of unsatisfied boosters as Texas Tech was struggling toward its worst since season since 2015, when Tubby Smith was still the coach.ADVERTISEMENTCorey Williams, the former coach at Stetson, led the Red Raiders on an interim basis in the conference tournament.College basketballReactions to the end of Jim Boeheim's career at SyracuseCal Poly ends 18-game skid thumping Long Beach St. in openerGardner leads Marist past Manhattan in MAAC tourney openerSharp leads Northwestern St. past New Orleans in SouthlandThey hung tough with West Virginia for about the first 12 minutes, and even led 24-23 on a basket by Jaylon Tyson.
