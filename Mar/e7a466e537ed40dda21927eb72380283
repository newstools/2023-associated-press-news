When it goes in, it’s a bonus. It’s a plus.”It went in early and often against Orlando.The Bucks went 26 of 56 from 3-point range. Grayson Allen, AJ Green, Joe Ingles and Brook Lopez each sank four 3-pointers. Antetokounmpo and Pat Connaughton added three each.“I didn’t even realize we hit that many 3′s,” said Lopez, who scored 18 points and shot 4 of 5 from beyond the arc. “I knew we hit a lot, but that’s a lot of 3s.”ADVERTISEMENTMilwaukee’s win streak is the longest in the NBA since the Phoenix Suns won 18 in a row early last season.
