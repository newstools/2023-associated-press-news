ANGERS, France (AP) — Angers fans burned part of the goal net in a 2-0 home defeat to Toulouse in the French league on Sunday, forcing the game to be briefly suspended for repairs. After Toulouse striker Thijs Dallinga doubled the visitors’ lead in the 47th, some Angers supporters set off fireworks behind home keeper Paul Bernardoni’s goal, burning the back of the net. Bottom-side Angers could face sanctions by the French league’s disciplinary commission for the incident. This has been a rocky week for Angers after coach Abdel Bouhazama resigned on Tuesday after making sexist comments.Dozens of fans gathered in front of the stadium before Sunday’s game to call for the resignation of club president Said Chabane, who is facing sexual assault accusations. ___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports
