Jackson can negotiate with other teams, and if he reaches an agreement with one, Baltimore can match it or let the star quarterback leave for two first-round draft picks. No matter who the quarterback is, the Ravens could really use an upgrade at receiver, but that might have to come via the trade route given their salary cap situation.AVAILABLE SALARY CAP SPACE (approximately): $8 million over.___AP NFL coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL
