LOS ANGELES CHARGERS (10-8) UNRESTRICTED FREE AGENTS: LB Morgan Fox, OT Trey Pipkins III, LB Drue Tranquill, LB Kyle Van Noy, S Nasir Adderley, CB Bryce Callahan, WR DeAndre Carter, C Will Clapp, DL Christian Covington, QB Chase Daniel, DL Tyeler Davison, LB Troy Reeder, TE Richard Rodgers, P JK Scott, QB Easton Stick.RESTRICTED FREE AGENTS: TE Donald Parham, WR Jalen Guyton, DL Breiden Fehoko, OT Storm Norton, DL Joe Gaziano, LB Derrek Tuszka.NEEDS: Finding more salary cap space. The Chargers have already restructured contracts for wide receivers Keenan Allen and Mike Williams, but will need to restructure more or cut a couple of players before they can begin addressing their needs. Los Angeles needs speed at the receiver position as well as durability after Allen and Williams missed a combined 11 games last season. Despite a spending spree on defense last year, Brandon Staleyâ€™s group was ranked 20th in total defense and was fifth worst against the run. The Chargers need to find some depth on the defensive line as well as linebacker. For as much as general manager Tom Telesco likes to talk about developing players, Allen is the only non-first round pick he has signed to a second contract during his 10-year tenure.NFLPanthers wish list includes adding tight end, defensive endFuture of Lamar Jackson, Aaron Rodgers clouds free agencySean McVay says he's back for the long haul with LA RamsTexans need receivers, linebackers as free agency approachesAVAILABLE SALARY CAP SPACE (approximately): $6.9 million over the cap.___ AP NFL coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL
