KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — A man who appeared to be shot dead by Russian-speakers in a short video was tentatively identified Tuesday as a missing Ukrainian soldier while the footage circulated widely on Ukrainian social media and caused an uproar.The country’s chief prosecutor announced a criminal investigation into the killing, and human rights chief Dmytro Lubinets argued that it was a violation of the Geneva Conventions.Senior Ukrainian officials alleged, without providing further evidence, that the man was an unarmed prisoner of war killed by Russian soldiers. In the video, the man did not appear to be armed.The 30th Mechanized Brigade on its Facebook page named the man as Tymofii Shadura. The identification is based on preliminary information and is not final, it said.Shadura has been missing for just over a month, since disappearing during bitter fighting in the Bakhmut area of eastern Ukraine, the post said. The city has been a combat hot spot as the war extends into its second year.ADVERTISEMENTHis identity is to be confirmed once the body is returned from a Russian-occupied area, the post added, though it did not say when that might happen.The Ukrainian military’s general staff gave the same name for the dead soldier, saying it was “according to preliminary information.”In the 12-second video, the man in combat fatigues is seen in a wooded area smoking a cigarette.Someone off-camera is heard speaking in Russian. The man then says “Glory to Ukraine” and is hit by a volley of gunshots, falling into a hole in the ground, with an off-camera voice saying “Die,” followed by an expletive.The Associated Press could not verify the video’s authenticity, any details about when it was recorded or anything about the people involved.Questions sent by the AP to the Russian military about the clip did not immediately receive a reply.The video circulated widely on social media in Ukraine and unleashed an outcry.Russia-Ukraine warHouse GOP tries to scuttle resolution supporting UkraineBattle for Bakhmut takes center stage in war in UkraineHungarian delegation backs Sweden's NATO application'Oh my daughter': Volunteer medic, 29, buried in UkraineIn his nightly video address Monday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said: “I want us all together, in unity, to respond to (the soldier’s) words: “Glory to the hero!
