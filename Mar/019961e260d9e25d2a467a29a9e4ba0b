BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) — Romanian Prime Minister Nicolae Ciuca held talks Wednesday with his visiting Moldovan counterpart as the two neighbors seek to boost ties amid Russia’s ongoing war in Ukraine.Ciuca met with new Prime Minister Dorin Recean at the government headquarters in Bucharest, where the two leaders discussed topics including regional security, economy, energy cooperation. They also discussed Romania’s assistance to Moldova in its bid to one day join the European Union.In a news conference afterwards, Ciuca noted that the war in Ukraine has had “massive consequences” on Moldova, an EU candidate country since last June, and he vowed to continue supporting the former Soviet republic’s path toward the 27-nation bloc.“We are witnessing more and more attempts to destabilize the Republic of Moldova by artificially creating tensions, as well as hostile narratives,” Ciuca said, adding that Romania will stand by Moldova “to overcome the current crises and hybrid pressures” it faces.ADVERTISEMENTHe added that the two countries, which both border Ukraine, will look to “speed up interconnection projects in the field of electricity,” which he said is important for ensuring Moldova’s energy independence. In recent months, Moldova faced a severe energy crisis after Russia dramatically reduced its gas supplies.
