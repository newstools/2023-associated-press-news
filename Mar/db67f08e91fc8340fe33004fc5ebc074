PITTSBURGH STEELERS (9-8) UNRESTRICTED FREE AGENTS: S Terrell Edmunds, CB Cam Sutton, S Damontae Kazee, S Karl Joseph, DT Larry Ogunjobi, DT Tyson Alualu, DE Chris Wormley, LB Rob Spillane, LB Devin Bush, LB Malik Reed, LB Marcus Allen, WR Miles Boykin, TE Zach Gentry, QB Mason Rudolph, RB Benny Snell, FB Derek Watt, Trent Scott, OL Jesse Davis.RESTRICTED FREE AGENTS: WR Steve Sims, DB James Pierre, OL J.C. Hassenauer, RB Jeremy McNichols.NEEDS: The Steelers thought Devin Bush was going to be a long-term fixture at inside linebacker when they traded up to draft him in 2019. They thought wrong. Bush was never the same after tearing the ACL in his left knee in 2020 and is expected to walk in free agency. They may find a way to keep Spillane, who was solid if not spectacular when his role increased after Bush fell out of favor. The aging defensive line will need to be revamped, though Ogunjobi may have played so well that he priced himself out of Pittsburgh. The secondary is an issue too, particularly at cornerback. An offensive line that gelled as the season went along could largely stay intact, at least in free agency. Given more pressing (and potentially expensive) needs elsewhere, itâ€™s more likely the Steelers go looking for a potential starter at left tackle in the draft.NFLPanthers wish list includes adding tight end, defensive endFuture of Lamar Jackson, Aaron Rodgers clouds free agencySean McVay says he's back for the long haul with LA RamsTexans need receivers, linebackers as free agency approachesAVAILABLE SALARY CAP SPACE (approximately): Slightly over the cap as of March 10.___AP NFL coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL
