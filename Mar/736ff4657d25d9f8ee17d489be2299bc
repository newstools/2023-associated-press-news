LONDON (AP) — Richarlison responded to some pre-match criticism from his own manager by helping Tottenham secure a 3-1 win over Nottingham Forest in the Premier League on Saturday.The Brazil striker played a key role in the second of Harry Kane’s two first-half goals and Tottenham’s third by Son Heung-min after the break.In his news conference on Friday, Tottenham manager Antonio Conte described Richarlison as “selfish” for complaining about his lack of playing time and said the striker was correct to assess his season so far as “not good.”Still, Conte handed Richarlison a start against Forest and was repaid with an all-action display that nearly included an early goal, only for the strike to be ruled out for offside.The win consolidated fourth place for Tottenham in the race for Champions League qualification and came a few hours after Liverpool — its big rival for the top four — lost surprisingly at Bournemouth 1-0 in the lunchtime kickoff.ADVERTISEMENTTottenham moved six points clear of fifth-place Liverpool.Kane headed home the opener in the 19th and converted a 35th-minute penalty after Richarlison was fouled.Richarlison crossed for Son to control and finish sweetly in the 62nd before Joe Worrall scored a consolation in the 81st for Forest, whose substitute Andre Ayew had a penalty saved by Fraser Forster in stoppage time.___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports
