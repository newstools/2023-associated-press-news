An extremely tight salary cap situation doesn’t provide general manager Jason Licht and coach Todd Bowles much flexibility to pursue a proven replacement for Brady while also retaining key defensive components such as David, Dean, Murphy-Bunting and Edwards, who figure to attract attention from other teams in free agency. There’s still a lot of maneuvering to do to get under the salary cap. Once that’s done, the emphasis will be on getting younger and faster. Licht and Bowles are confident the Bucs can do that while remaining competitive.AVAILABLE SALARY CAP SPACE (approximately): $ 47 million over the cap.___AP NFL coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL
