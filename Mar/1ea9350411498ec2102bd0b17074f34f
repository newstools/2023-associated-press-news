BANGKOK (AP) — The brother of Singapore’s prime minister is accusing government authorities of persecuting his family after it emerged that he and his wife were under official investigation.Lee Hsien Yang has long been at odds with his brother, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, over the will of their late father — Singapore’s first prime minister, Lee Kuan Yew.The family feud had largely died down until Senior Minister and Coordinating Minister for National Security Teo Chee Hean told lawmakers that Lee Hsien Yang and his wife, Lee Suet Fern, were under investigation.In a written answer to parliament made public Thursday, he said the two were being investigated over allegations of providing false evidence in judicial proceedings regarding the will.They are accused of lying under oath by a panel of three judges and a disciplinary tribunal, Teo Chee Hean wrote.He told parliament the two had agreed to an interview with police but then later refused, which he said was “disappointing.”ADVERTISEMENT“The police have advised them to reconsider participating in investigations, but they have since left Singapore and remain out of the country,” he wrote, according to a copy of the reply to parliament provided by his office on Friday.
