CHICAGO (AP) — Dawson Garcia had 18 points, 13 rebounds and six assists and Ta’lon Cooper had 16 points and set the program record for assists in a Big Ten Tournament game with 12 to help Minnesota beat Nebraska 78-75 Wednesday night in an opening-round game.The 14th-seeded Golden Gophers, who have won two of their last three following a 12-game skid, play No. 6 seed Maryland in the second round Thursday.

Jaden Henley added 14 points for Minnesota (9-21) and Jamison Battle scored 13 with eight rebounds. Henley was fouled on a 3-pointer as the shot clock expired and hit all three free throws to give Minnesota a six-point lead with three minutes to go. Sam Griesel scored back-to-back contested baskets to pull the Cornhuskers to 63-61 with 1:39 remaining but Nebraska was called for offensive fouls on their next two possessions before Cooper made 1-of-2 free throws to put the Golden Gophers up by three with 27 seconds to go.ADVERTISEMENTGriesel went high in the air to snag a long inbounds pass and then hit a cutting Keisei Tominaga for a layup to make it 64-63 with 20 seconds left. But Cooper hit 3 of 4 from the free throw-line from there — and Tominaga missed a potential tying shot from near midcourt at the buzzer.
