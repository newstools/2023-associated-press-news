He left St. Bonaventure to coach at Providence, where he and the school mutually agreed to part ways on Tuesday following a 13-18 season.The 52-year-old Crowley finished with an 85-125 record and one postseason berth (WNIT in 2019) over seven seasons with the Big East Friars.At St. Bonaventure, he takes over for Jesse Fleming, who succeeded Crowley in 2017.

The Atlantic 10 Bonnies finished the season with a 6-26 record, marking the sixth time in seven seasons they failed to win 10 or more games.ADVERTISEMENT“Bonaventure is home. It never left me. The people, the memories and the spirit have always been in me,” Crowley said in a release. “It isn’t just a place; it’s a feeling; it’s a community that’s unmatched. I’m thrilled to come back.”__AP women’s college basketball: https://apnews.com/hub/womens-college-basketball and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-womens-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25
