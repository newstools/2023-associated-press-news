MANCHESTER, England (AP) — Manchester United held firm after Casemiro’s second red card in his last three Premier League games to secure a 0-0 draw with last-place Southampton on Sunday.The Brazil midfielder was sent off in the 34th minute for a studs-up challenge on Carlos Alcaraz that initially earned him a yellow card. The referee changed it to a red after the VAR advised him to look at the incident again on the pitchside monitor.Casemiro must now serve a four-match ban, given it was his second sending-off of the season. His other was at Crystal Palace on Feb. 4.Southampton had the better of the chances in Casemiro’s absence, twice hitting the goal frame through James Ward-Prowse — off a trademark curling free kick — and Kyle Walker-Peters and seeing United defender Aaron Wan-Bissaka clear the ball of the line.At the other end, Bruno Fernandes had a long-range shot tipped onto the post by Southampton goalkeeper Gavin Bazunu.ADVERTISEMENTThird-place United moved two points clear of fourth-place Tottenham and has a game in hand.Southampton stayed in last place, with the bottom nine in the league — up to 12th-place Crystal Palace — separated by just five points.___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports
