Northwestern hurried downcourt and turned an offensive rebound into a Caileigh Webb 3-pointer. A blocked shot led to a Jillian Brown 3-pointer to cut the deficit to 62-60 with 47.5 seconds to go.That’s when Bryant hit a stepback 3 just before the shotclock expired. But Bostic fouled Brown, who made the first free throw at 10.8 seconds and missed the second, which the Wildcats rebounded. Courtney Shaw then had a putback and was fouled, converting the three-point play for a 65-64 score with 4.2 to go.
