CLEVELAND (AP) — Former Cleveland quarterback Bernie Kosar made a costly bet.The Browns fired the beloved Kosar from their pregame radio broadcast before the season finale against Pittsburgh after he violated NFL policy by placing a wager earlier this week after sports gambling became legal in Ohio.Kosar had made a ceremonial bet of $19,000 — he wore No. 19 during his career in Cleveland — on the Browns to beat the rival Steelers with the Tipico Sportsbook app.The Browns say they had no other choice but to relieve him of his duties.“We understand what Bernie means to this community and our history,” the team said in a statement Sunday night, released after the Browns lost 28-14 to finish 7-10. “But as team contracted personnel hired to provide content on our media platforms his bet was a violation of NFL rules and we must adhere to all NFL policy.”Kosar will also no longer be a regular guest on the team’s in-house radio program.ADVERTISEMENTEarlier, the 59-year-old Kosar had expressed disappointment with the decision with a posting on Twitter.“Steelers GameDay yet once again I was informed by the Browns that my services are no longer desired or needed.” Kosar wrote. “I am shocked & disappointed. Brown & Orange is my life … Go #Browns.”NFLColts' Saturday awaits coaching decision; Texans fire SmithBills win for Hamlin and eliminate Patriots from playoffsGiants already looking ahead to playoff rematch with VikingsWilson, Broncos beat Herbert, playoff-bound Chargers 31-28Kosar remains one of the franchise’s most popular players.
