LOS ANGELES (AP) — California’s weather was calmer Tuesday after weeks of atmospheric rivers that slammed the state with damaging rains, wind and surf that flooded homes, highways and farm fields, collapsed hillsides and toppled countless trees. Tallying the damage will take time, but the number of homes and other structures that will be red-tagged as uninhabitable could be in the “low thousands,” said Brian Ferguson, spokesperson for the Governor’s Office of Emergency Services. The damage is spread across 41 of California’s 58 counties, Ferguson said.Light rain and snow showers lingered in some areas, but skies were finally largely clear.A shot of precipitation from a quick system was predicted for Wednesday or Thursday, followed by a dry period, the National Weather Service said.Forecasters cautioned that although the midweek rainfall will be light, it could be enough to cause problems because the state is so saturated.ADVERTISEMENTFlood warnings remained in effect for the Salinas River in Monterey County and parts of Mariposa and Merced counties in the Central Valley.Nine atmospheric rivers since late December have caused power outages, flooding, levee breaks, washouts and landslides.
