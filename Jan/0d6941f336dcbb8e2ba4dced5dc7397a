ANKARA, Turkey (AP) — Iran welcomes steps toward a reconciliation between Turkey and Syria and is ready to help move the efforts forward, Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian said Tuesday.The Iranian minister made the comments in Ankara, weeks after the Turkish and Syrian defense ministers held talks in Moscow. It was the first ministerial-level meeting between Damascus and Ankara since relations broke down with the start of the Syrian civil war nearly 12 years ago.“We are very pleased that the relations between Damascus and Ankara have undergone a change recently,” Amirabdollahian said during a joint news conference with his Turkish counterpart, Mevlut Cavusoglu. “We think that any development between Ankara and Damascus — this positive development — will benefit our region, the two countries and (Iran). Considering its close relationship with these two countries, as the Islamic Republic of Iran, we will do our best to achieve this goal as soon as possible.”ADVERTISEMENTTurkey and Syria have stood on opposing sides of the Syrian conflict, with Turkey backing rebels trying to oust Syrian President Bashar Assad.
