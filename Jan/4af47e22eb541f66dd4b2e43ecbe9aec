SYDNEY (AP) — Rafael Nadal lost again at the United Cup mixed teams tournament, chalking up Monday’s defeat to Alex De Minaur to rustiness.The second-ranked Nadal lost to the Australian 3-6 6-1 7-5 after having been beaten by Britain’s Cameron Norrie in three sets.The record 22-time Grand Slam champion said he needs more matches like Monday’s to be ready for his Australian Open title defense.“I need hours on court. I need battles like this. I didn’t play much official matches the last six months, almost seven,” said the 36-year-old Spaniard, who battled foot, rib and abdomen injuries last year.“I have two weeks before the Australian Open starts. I can’t say that the situation is ideal but, at the same time, I can’t say that it’s very negative, because for moments I was playing good.”Both teams went into the match knowing they couldn’t advance after losing to Britain, which will face the United States in the knockout stage on Wednesday for a spot in the semifinals.ADVERTISEMENTThe US ensured it will top Group C by opening up a 2-0 lead over Germany, with Madison Keys beating Jule Niemeier after Taylor Fritz defeated Alexander Zverev.Taylor Fritz took advantage of a dominant serve to beat Zverev 6-1, 6-4.TennisMartina Navratilova diagnosed with throat, breast cancerVenus Williams earns long-awaited victory in AucklandDjokovic gets warm welcome in doubles loss at AdelaideAndreescu beats Muguruza at Adelaide InternationalKeys extended the United States’ lead to 2-0 with a 6-2, 6-3 win over Niemeier.
