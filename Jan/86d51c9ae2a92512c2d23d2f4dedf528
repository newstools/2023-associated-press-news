As I said before the game, we’re playing with heavy hearts, but we’re also playing for our city that’s going through a lot right now.”ADVERTISEMENT“So, it’s hard, but our guys went out there and competed. I told them the last two games, as we’ve been talking about everything that’s been going on in Memphis with the tragedy to Tyre Nichols, we’ve been staying together.”Jenkins said he had not watched the video footage of the incident when speaking after the game and didn’t think the team had a chance to watch before the game.
