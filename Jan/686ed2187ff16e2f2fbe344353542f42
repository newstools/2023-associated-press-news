From 1954 until 2018, he participated in 271 races in the NASCAR K&N Pro Series West (now ARCA Menards West Series), winning 34 races and posting 100 top-five finishes. He captured the series championship in 1986 at 58 years old and finished second in points in 1985 and 1987.The four were selected to the Hall of Fame last May.Kenseth was a driver who earned the respect of his contemporaries, including Jimmie Johnson and Kevin Harvick.Johnson, a seven-time Cup champion, said some of his fiercest battles on the racetrack have been with Kenseth.“There was always just a deep level of trust that we’re going to give 100%, not step over the line, not clean each other out,” Johnson said. ”... As a competitor, he was one of the few that I knew we’d race hard but we wouldn’t cross the line.”Johnson said the two forged a friendship away from the track riding bicycles.“I absolutely call him a friend,” Johnson said. “His family, his kids are close my kids, our wives are close, like we’ve really become friends and I am so thankful for it.”ADVERTISEMENTHarvick also described Kenseth as a fair driver, but added that he is “that sneaky guy that would dump you.”“If you did him wrong, he was going to give back exactly what he got,” Harvick said. “As you look back at Matt, he was one of the rare few that would always just figure it out and find his way to the front by the time that the race was over. He’s a great hardcore good racer and I always respected him.”___AP Motorsports Writer Jenna Fryer contributed to this report___AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports
