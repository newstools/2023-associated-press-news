MILAN (AP) — A quiet deadline day in Italy brought to an end a winter transfer period that saw the lowest spending by Serie A clubs in almost two decades.Serie A clubs spent a total of 28.42 million euros ($30.89 million) on transfers in January, their lowest expenditure since 2006, when they spent 13.56 million euros ($14.7 million).The biggest outlay was by Fiorentina — for a player already at the club.Fiorentina made Antonín Barák’s move from Hellas Verona permanent on deadline day on Tuesday, paying 8.5 million euros ($9.24 million) for the Czech Republic international, who had been on loan at the Tuscan club since August.January transfer windows are usually less exciting than those in the summer and Italian soccer is still recovering financially from the coronavirus pandemic. But even last year, Serie A clubs splashed out 185 million euros ($201 million).None of the top four teams — Napoli, Inter Milan, Lazio, Atalanta — spent anything this month. Defending champion AC Milan and sixth-place Roma, who are also both pushing hard for the Champions League qualifying places, spent just 500,000 euros ($543,000) on loan deals.ADVERTISEMENTRoma signed Spain defender Diego Llorente from Leeds until the end of the season on Tuesday, while Milan brought in goalkeeper Devis Vásquez from Paraguayan outfit Guaraní earlier this month.SoccerEriksen facing long spell out; United set to sign SabitzerSlow transfer day in Spain; Barcelona set to register GaviNigeria striker Moffi joins French league club NiceEuropean king Real Madrid out to rule Club World Cup againThere was also no outlay by Juventus this month, although defender Luca Pellegrini joined Lazio on loan.
