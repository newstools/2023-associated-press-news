WACO, Texas (AP) — DeYona Gaston grabbed 11 rebounds and was one of four Texas players to score 13 points to help the 25th-ranked Longhorns beat Baylor 68-55 Sunday. Shaylee Gonzales, Rori Harmon and Sonya Morris all scored 13 as well for Texas. Taylor Jones added 10 points, seven rebounds and three blocks. Texas (14-6, 5-2 Big 12), which beat then-No. 23 Kansas and then-No. 15 Iowa State last week to cap a stretch of 10 wins in 11 games, bounced back from a 68-64 loss at Texas Tech on Wednesday. The Longhorns moved into a second-place tie with Iowa State — a game behind Oklahoma — in the conference standings. Harmon, who also had six rebounds and six assists, lost the ball and fell to the ground as she drove into the lane with 3:35 to play. The 5-foot-6 guard — who last season became the first freshman in program history to be earn All-America honors (honorable mention) — remained down for a couple minutes before gingerly walking off the court with an apparent knee injury. She did not return.ADVERTISEMENTThe Longhorns led 24-22 at intermission despite shooting 28% (9 of 23) from the field and going 0 for 8 from 3-point range. Texas scored 28 third-quarter points and shot 19 of 34 (55.9%) from the field over the final 20 minutes.
