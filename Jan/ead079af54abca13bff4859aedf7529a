Conner — who did not play in the first half — checked in with 6:26 left in the third quarter and scored 11 points in a 14-3 run that gave the Wildcats a 52-48 lead with about 2 minutes left in the period. There were three lead changes and two ties before Conner hit a 3-pointer that made it 65-63 with 4:10 to play and Arizona never again trailed. The Wildcats, who entered the game shooting 65.8% from the free-throw line this season (No. 281 nationally), made 8 of 8 foul shots in the final 36 seconds to seal it. Connor finished shooting 3 of 4 from the field, including three 3s, and hit 7 of 7 from the free-throw line — the last two came after she grabbed her second rebound and made it 77-71 with 12 seconds to go.
