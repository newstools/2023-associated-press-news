COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) — A 16-year-old was charged Thursday with joining an international white supremacist group and having tried to recruit another person to the group, which Danish authorities described as neo-Nazi and a terrorist group. The prosecution said the teenager had promoted the activities of Feuerkrieg Division by having “participated in the preparation of a handbook, which describes the terrorist group’s purpose and expectations of its members, as well as shared extremist material as well as bomb and weapons manuals.” This was done via the messaging app Telegram.Prosecutor Lise-Lotte Nilas said that authorities believe ”the 16-year-old has assumed a leadership role in the neo-Nazi Feuerkrieg Division in relation to how the terrorist group was to be organized, including how it could gain more members.” She said what the teenager who was not identified, had done was serious “because it can increase the risk that other people will commit acts of terrorism.”ADVERTISEMENTThe teenager from eastern Denmark was first arrested in April 2022. A trial is set to start on March 14 in Holbaek, some 55 kilometers (34 miles) west of Copenhagen.Feuerkrieg Division has been advocating for a race war and promotes some of the most extreme views of the white supremacist movement.
