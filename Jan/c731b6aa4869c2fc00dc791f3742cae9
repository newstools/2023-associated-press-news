RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) — Virginia quarterback Brennan Armstrong is transferring to North Carolina State.Armstrong announced his decision in a social media post Saturday. The move allows him to reunite with his former offensive coordinator Robert Anae, who directed the Cavaliers’ offense during the most productive years of Armstrong’s career with the Cavaliers and recently signed on to lead the Wolfpack’s attack.Armstrong threw for 4,449 yards and 31 touchdowns in 2021, including a program-record 554 yards in a loss at North Carolina. But he struggled last year in a different offense under first-year coach Tony Elliott.Armstrong’s arrival gives the Wolfpack a veteran option after losing Devin Leary to Kentucky. Leary was the preseason Atlantic Coast Conference player of the year but missed the second half of the year with an injury, while N.C. State cycled through three other starting quarterbacks for the rest of the season.___AP college football: https://apnews.com/hub/college-football and https://twitter.com/ap_top25
