PITTSBURGH (AP) — Pittsburgh Penguins goaltender Tristan Jarry’s on-again, off-again season is now off again.Coach Mike Sullivan said Wednesday that the two-time All-Star will miss at least two games with an upper-body injury.Jarry was scheduled to start Tuesday night against Florida but reported an upper-body issue when he arrived at PPG Paints Arena. Casey DeSmith got the last-second start as the Penguins pulled out a wild 7-6 victory over the Panthers.Jarry is out through at least the All-Star break. Pittsburgh plays at Washington on Thursday and then hosts San Jose on Saturday before getting a full week off.The 27-year-old Jarry has played well when he’s been in the lineup, posting a 16-5-5 record with a 2.65 goals-against average in 27 games. His availability, however, has been an issue of late. He missed more than two weeks earlier this month after being injured against Boston in the Winter Classic on Jan. 2.ADVERTISEMENTThe Penguins are not as sharp when Jarry is out. Pittsburgh is 8-10-3 with DeSmith or Dustin Tokarski in goal this season. The Penguins recalled Tokarski from their American Hockey League affiliate in Wilkes-Barre/Scranton to back up DeSmith during Jarry’s absence.___AP NHL: www.apnews.com/hub/NHL and www.twitter.com/AP_Sports
