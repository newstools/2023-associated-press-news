Andy Beshear said Thursday.“This program has been a big success getting significant dollars out there,” Beshear said. “But like a federal program that’s designed for a specific period of time, at some point the dollars do run out.”Beshear said the program would resume if more federal dollars arrive. He said the remaining funds in will be used to fund programs that help those the most at risk of eviction and homelessness.The fund also provided $23 million in utility and internet assistance to Kentuckians.
