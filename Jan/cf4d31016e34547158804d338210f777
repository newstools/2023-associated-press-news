EDMONTON, Alberta (AP) — Tyson Barrie scored twice, Connor McDavid had his NHL-best 41st goal and the Edmonton Oilers headed into their All-Star break with a 7-3 victory over the Chicago Blackhawks on Saturday night.McDavid, Leon Draisaitl and Zach Hyman each had a goal and two assists, and Evander Kane and Ryan McLeod also scored for the Oilers (28-18-4). They are 7-0-1 in their last eight games.“We took over in the second period, but there were still a couple of things I’d like to clean up,” Oilers coach Jay Woodcroft said. “But our team is 10-3-2 since the Christmas break and you couldn’t script it better for us. I think we’ve taken a step here, it’s a credit to our players.”Jason Dickinson, Jonathan Toews and Taylor Raddysh scored for the Blackhawks (15-29-4). They have lost three of their last four.“We had a great start, but we maybe just stopped skating a little bit from what we had done in the first,” Blackhawks forward Patrick Kane said. “It would have been nice to control it a little more in the second, those are usually make-or-break periods.”ADVERTISEMENTOilers netminder Stuart Skinner came down with a sudden illness, forcing them to activate emergency backup goalie Matt Berlin, a player from the University of Alberta Golden Bears. With the big lead, the Oilers put him in net with 2:26 to play, and he stopped the only shot he faced.NHLHurricanes take winning streak into home matchup against the BruinsJets host the Blues on losing streakZegras scores in OT, Ducks beat Coyotes for 3rd win a rowWennberg scores against former team, Kraken top Blue JacketsJack Campbell started and made 25 saves for the Oilers.Petr Mrazek scored 36 shots for Chicago.UP NEXT:Blackhawks: Host Anaheim on Tuesday, Feb. 7.Oilers: At Detroit on Tuesday, Feb. 7.___AP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/NHL and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports
