MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) — Italian tennis player Camila Giorgi has denied allegations that she obtained a false COVID-19 vaccine certificate to allow her to travel. A doctor is under investigation in Italy for supplying false certificates and fake vaccines and Giorgi’s name was revealed in a long list of people implicated by an Italian newspaper.On Tuesday after her 6-0, 6-1 win over Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova at the Australian Open, Giorgi confirmed that she had visited the doctor but said she had done nothing wrong. “I just did all my vaccination in different places, so the trouble is hers, not me,” she said. “So with that, I’m very calm. Of course, if not, I couldn’t come here and play this tennis, I think.” Giorgi said she was vaccinated by the Italian doctor, and by medical officials in countries elsewhere.“Once. The other vaccination, I did it in different kind of places, so it’s what I’m trying to explain,” she said.ADVERTISEMENTHer father, Sergio Giorgi, was sat at the back of the interview room on Tuesday at Melbourne Park and when the media conference ended, he said: “Unbelievable, no questions about tennis.”Ahead of the tournament, Tennis Australia chief executive Craig Tiley said he was not fully aware of the fake certificate claims.TennisAndy Murray edges Berrettini in 5 sets at Australian OpenAfter 1st vacation, Taylor Townsend gets 1st Slam win as momAustralian Open bans flags from Russia, Belarus on siteAt Australian Open, some players say they ignore the bracket“I think there’s still a lot to be uncovered on that and I think that’s going to be ultimately up to their family and the relevant authorities including the tour,” he said. “I don’t really know any further detail.”___AP tennis: https://apnews.com/hub/tennis and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports
