LONDON (AP) — U.K. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak apologized Thursday for taking off his seat belt to film a social media video in a moving car.A spokesman said Sunak made an “error of judgment” while filming a message for Instagram from the back of an official government car during a visit to northwest England.Spokesman Jamie Davies said the prime minister “fully accepts this was a mistake and apologizes.”“The prime minister believes everyone should wear a seat belt,” he said.Failing to wear a seat belt is punishable in the U.K. by a fine of up to 500 pounds ($620).Sunak’s travel arrangements also drew criticism after it emerged he took a 28-minute flight on a taxpayer-funded jet from northwest to northeast England as he promoted government funding for community projects on Thursday.
