WARSAW, Poland (AP) — The United Nations cultural organization is training law enforcement and judiciary officials from countries on Ukraine’s western borders, seeking to prevent the trafficking of looted cultural objects from Ukraine amid Russia’s war against its neighbor.UNESCO partnered with Poland’s Culture Ministry to hold three days of workshops in Warsaw this week for the officials from Poland, Hungary, Slovakia, Romania and Moldova. Representatives from Ukraine also attended the training that began on Wednesday.The aim is for the officials to be able to identify and prevent any artistic treasures looted in Ukraine from crossing their borders. Krista Pikkat, UNESCO’s director of culture and emergencies, said that more than 230 cultural sites have been damaged or destroyed in Ukraine since Russia invaded the country.She said that UNESCO is working to document lost cultural objects, among them treasures from museums and archaeological sites.ADVERTISEMENTAnother priority for the agency is making sure that the wider public is aware that looted Ukrainian treasures could end up on art markets in Europe, so that buyers are more careful about what they buy. Pikkat described Poland as a strong partner for UNESCO in the protection of cultural heritage in situations of conflict because it has learned many lessons from its own experiences.Russia-Ukraine warGermany pressed on tanks for Ukraine; Kyiv airs frustrationRussia, China to hold naval drills off South AfricaEU assembly wants special court for Russia's war in UkraineUkraine helicopter crash kills interior minister, othersPoland suffered mass looting of its cultural heritage during World War II, when it was invaded and occupied by Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union.
