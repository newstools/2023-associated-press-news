HOBART, Australia (AP) — Former Australian Open champion Sofia Kenin is two wins away from her first title in three years after coming from behind to make the semifinals of the Hobart International.The 24-year-old Kenin, who beat Anhelina Kalinina 4-6, 6-3, 6-1 on Thursday, is ranked 280th after a career-high ranking of No. 4. Injuries and poor form saw her ranking plummet after her win at Melbourne Park in 2020.It is the American’s first semifinal at a WTA level or higher since her run to the final of the French Open in 2020.“I just tried to keep on fighting. She’s a tough player to play. I knew I had to hang in there,” Kenin, the 2019 Hobart winner, said. “Match after match I’m playing better and better. I hope I can keep it going.”Kenin will meet Italian 21-year-old Elisabetta Cocciaretto for a place in the final.Cocciaretto, who upset third-seeded Alize Cornet in the first round, had a 5-7, 7-6 (6), 6-4 victory over sixth-seeded Bernarda Pera.On Thursday, Kenin drew a tough Australian Open first-round match against two-time champion and No. 25 Victoria Azarenka.___AP tennis: https://apnews.com/hub/tennis and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports
