The union didn’t release details about what is included in the new four-year contract.“This has been a long and difficult fight for our striking members and their families. With each new day on that picket line, fighting for what they deserve, our members grew in strength, courage and determination,” union president Anthony Shelton said. “I could not be more proud of these hard working members who put it all out on the line to fight for a fair contract.”Officials at the Chicago-based company didn’t immediately respond to questions Sunday. Ingredion has more than 11,000 employees worldwide and reports annual sales of nearly $6 billion. It reported a third-quarter profit of $106 million.ADVERTISEMENTThis strike began Aug. 1 as Ingredion workers fought for improved benefits and wages along with stronger seniority and work rules.
