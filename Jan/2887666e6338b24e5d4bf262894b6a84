SAN DIEGO (AP) — Jaelen House scored 29 points, including three clutch 3-pointers down the stretch, and Jamal Mashburn Jr. had 22 for New Mexico, which used a 12-0 run to take control in beating No. 23 San Diego State 76-67 on Saturday night. House, who played better the more he was booed by the crowd, had 10 points during the 12-0 run that gave the Lobos a 60-49 lead, and 13 points in a span of about three minutes. He scored 21 in the second half.House was whistled for a technical with about five minutes to go for staring at the crowd.“I don’t like them, they don’t like me,” House said. “I like big-time moments.”New Mexico won its first 15 games before losing 71-67 at Fresno State on Jan. 3.“We weren’t hungry these past few games and I feel like we came out hungry tonight,” House said.Morris Udeze had 10 points and 15 rebounds, and Javonte Johnson had 10 points for the Lobos (16-2, 3-2 Mountain West). The Lobos fell out of The Associated Press Top 25 after two losses last week while the Aztecs jumped back into the poll.

House made both free throws and then hit a 3-pointer for a five-point possession and a 53-49 Lobos lead. Mashburn made a jumper and House made a 3-pointer and another jumper for a 60-49 lead with 6:01 to go. SDSU’s Micah Parrish made one of two free throws to end New Mexico’s run before House made another 3-pointer for a 63-50 lead.Mensah fouling out changed the tone of the second half.“I’d say that was a big part because he’s a big body down there and he’s affecting shots,” House said. “They don’t really have a backup that’s doing the same things he’s doing.”The Aztecs scored five straight points after House was called for a technical but it wasn’t nearly enough.ADVERTISEMENT“We’ve both got learning experiences in our locker room. Celebrate after the game,” Pitino said. “House was terrific, but sometimes you’ve just got to like stun gun him a little bit and slow him down. But he was so good. Those refs, when you celebrate like that, they’re going to get you.”The Aztecs pulled within four points before Udeze scored inside. Mashburn hit a jumper and two free throws in the final 1:20.Mashburn and Udeze led the Lobos to a 38-28 halftime lead before the Aztecs tightened their defense and caught up seven minutes into the second half.
