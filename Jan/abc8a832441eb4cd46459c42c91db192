NEW YORK (AP) — Procter & Gamble Co., the maker of Crest toothpaste and Charmin toilet paper, raised its full-year sales outlook, helped by price hikes. But the consumer products giant cautioned that higher commodity prices continue to squeeze profits, and there’s been some pushback from shoppers who cut back their purchases of staples over higher price tags.The upgraded outlook, issued Thursday, came as the Cincinnati-based company reported lower fiscal second-quarter earnings and sales from a year ago, though the results beat Wall Street expectations.Like many consumer product makers, P&G has been forced to raise prices on its wide array of products to offset higher costs in transportation, labor and other areas, and it said it will continue to raise prices. In the latest quarter, P&G said it had to hike prices by 10%. Still, shoppers have remained fairly resilient to buying essentials like shampoo and laundry detergent. The company has also offered various cheaper options within its portfolio to hold on to price-sensitive shoppers.ADVERTISEMENTP&G said that the number of products it sold globally was down 6% in the quarter ended Dec. 31 — half of that was because shoppers were cutting back their consumption, while the rest was due to inventory reductions in Russia and China.BusinessAI tools can create new images, but who is the real artist?US Treasury buys time for Biden and GOP on debt limit dealUS stocks lose ground as recession fears weigh on marketClimate misinformation 'rocket boosters' on Musk's Twitter“The consumer is holding up remarkably well in the U.S.,” P&G finance chief Andre Schulten told reporters on a call Thursday.
