He is averaging 5.1 rebounds and 1.6 steals per game.The Hornets are also likely to be without Gordon Hayward for Wednesday night’s game against Memphis after he injured his hamstring on Monday night in a loss to the Los Angeles Lakers.___AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/nba and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports
