HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — Pennsylvania’s state Senate on Wednesday voted to undo an automatic wholesale tax increase on gasoline and diesel that kicks in this year in an effort to prevent motorists from paying more per gallon.The vote, 29-19, sent the bill to the state House of Representatives, where a partisan fight for control has paralyzed the chamber a week into the new legislative session.It’s not clear exactly how much of the wholesale tax increase will trickle down to motorists at the pump if the Legislature doesn’t pass the bill to negate it. The automatic tax increase was enacted nearly a decade ago when lawmakers sought to pump more money into improving highways and bridges.The action in Pennsylvania comes as five states that passed a broad gas tax holiday because of high pump prices — California, Connecticut, Georgia, Maryland and New York — move to resume fuel tax collections.ADVERTISEMENTUnder a 2013 state law in Pennsylvania, the wholesale tax on gasoline and diesel can float with the average wholesale price and, with high gas prices last year, the wholesale tax in Pennsylvania is rising to its highest point yet under the law.The law dictates that the average wholesale price cannot be below $2.99 per gallon. In 2022, the price rose above that threshold, triggering the tax increase.
