SALEM, N.H. (AP) — Chris Ager was elected chairman of the New Hampshire Republican Party on Saturday after promising to take a bolder approach in defining the party.Ager, a Republican National Committee member, defeated another longtime GOP activist, Lou Gargiulo. He said he already has a six-year plan focused on fighting what he called “radical and extremist” Democrats.“We’re like the calvary,” he said. “We’ve got to stop these people from destroying our country.”Republicans should stop trying to appeal to “people in the middle,” he argued.“We are not going to be Democrat-lite. That is no way to win,” he said. Ager replaces Stephen Stepanek, who stepped aside after four years. Required to stay neutral as chair, he immediately signed on as a senior adviser to former President Donald Trump’s attempted comeback campaign.Trump, who appeared at the convention, made the announcement in person.
