CHICAGO (AP) — The U.S. Soccer Federation is switching its Spanish-language U.S. broadcasts to Telemundo from Univision.The USSF said Tuesday the agreement with Telemundo, a division of Comcast Corp.’s NBC Universal, runs through 2026. The first telecast will be the U.S. women’s exhibition at New Zealand on Wednesday (10 p.m. EST Tuesday) and all matches also will be streamed on Peacock.English-language rights starting this year are held by Turner Sports, a division of WarnerMedia under an agreement announced last March.
