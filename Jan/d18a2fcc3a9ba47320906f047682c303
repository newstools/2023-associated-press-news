HA’IL, Saudi Arabia (AP) — Defending champion Nasser Al-Attiyah extended his lead of the Dakar Rally when he won the sandy fifth stage on Thursday.Al-Attiyah’s second win in the northern Saudi Arabia desert in the first week gave him a 22-minute gap on eight-time champion Stephane Peterhansel and 27 minutes on local driver Yazeed Al Rajhi.Al-Attiyah imposed himself about halfway through the 374-kilometer loop course around Ha’il.“We tried to really push like crazy,” the Qatari said. “We took a lot of risks. The other teams have more power and more horsepower but I’m happy to finish today without any problems. It’s very hard because the base is that we’re pushing a lot and we are really tired.”Sebastien Loeb was close to Al-Attiyah until he made a mistake on a dune, hit a big clump of camel grass and rolled his ProDrive on its side. The car was OK but Loeb lost almost 20 minutes.ADVERTISEMENTThree-time winner Carlos Sainz finished two minutes behind Al-Attiyah on the stage, and Peterhansel, who led the early going, was third.Both complained about how badly the rough track impacted their bodies, especially their necks. Sainz said, “We hope we can carry on and get to the end.”Peterhansel said, “It was one of the hardest stages in my life.”SportsFootball fans grapple with violent side of a beloved sportBills: Safety Damar Hamlin showing 'remarkable improvement'Back to work not business as usual for Damar Hamlin's peersCardiac events a frightening, familiar sight in the NHLFrench rider Adrien van Beveren was first home after four motorbike leaders lost their way around halfway for about 10-15 minutes.Joan Barreda, the stage four winner, Pablo Quintanilla, Skyler Howes and Toby Price — all in the top seven overall — had to turn around.Mason Klein moved to the front of the stage with Van Beveren and Jose Cornejo.Then Barreda fell 20 kilometers from the finish and banged his head and Price hit his bike.
