SYDNEY (AP) — Graham Arnold is set to become the first coach to lead Australia’s men’s team at successive FIFA World Cups after signing a four-year contract extension that will take him through the 2026 tournament.Arnold’s position had been in doubt last year as the team struggled to qualify for Qatar, but he then oversaw Australia’s most successful World Cup campaign, in which it won two group matches before losing to eventual champion Argentina in the round of 16.Arnold’s contract expired at the end of the World Cup. He had been considering offers overseas before Football Australia on Monday confirmed he had agreed to an extension.“I love Australia and I love Australian football and nothing in football can ever match the elation, pride and sense of achievement I and the entire set-up felt in Qatar,” the 59-year-old Arnold said in a statement.“The hunger to continue in the role has never been stronger and I know I have more to give to the Socceroos’ program and Australian football, where I want to deliver more smiles for our fans as we did in Qatar,” he added.ADVERTISEMENTArnold is the first national coach since Frank Farina to be awarded a second term. His first major goal will be the Asian Cup in Qatar in January 2024.
