A look at some of the key business events and economic indicators upcoming this week:HOMEBUILDER SPOTLIGHTKB Home delivers its fiscal fourth-quarter results Wednesday.Wall Street predicts the Los Angeles-based homebuilder will report that its earnings and revenue improved in the September-November period compared to the same quarter in 2021. That would echo the company’s results in the first three quarters of its last fiscal year. In September, the builder touted record third-quarter profits, but also noted a shortfall in delivered homes due partly to supply chain constraints.EYE ON INFLATIONThe Labor Department releases its December snapshot of inflation at the consumer level Thursday.While inflation remains painfully high for American households it has eased in recent months as the Federal Reserve continues its interest rate hiking campaign. Consumer prices rose 7.1% in November from a year earlier, slowing for the fifth straight month. Economists project the December reading will show inflation at the consumer level slowed to 6.5% from a year earlier, the smallest increase since October 2021.ADVERTISEMENTConsumer price index, annual percent change, not seasonally adjusted:July 8.5 Aug. 8.3Sept. 8.2InflationMexico ended 2022 with 7.82% annual inflationStocks climb on Wall Street, adding to gains made last weekLiz Weston: Sneaky ways inflation affects your money in 2023Lame-duck Illinois lawmakers vote themselves a 16% raiseOct. 7.8Nov. 7.1Dec.
