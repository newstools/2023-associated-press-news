The two-time NFL rushing champ sat out last week’s loss to Dallas with a hip injury and then turned 29 on Wednesday. Henry had 96 yards rushing in the first quarter against Jacksonville a month ago only to finish with 121. He also fumbled twice — only the second time he has done that in his career. Better ball security has been a big focus for Henry, who has three lost fumbles in his past three games.ADVERTISEMENTJAGUARS PLAYER TO WATCH: TE Evan Engram was close to unstoppable against the Titans four weeks ago, catching 11 passes for a career-high 162 yards and two touchdowns. He clearly was a matchup issue for Tennessee, which played without LBs David Long and Zach Cunningham as well as CB Kristian Fulton.NFLFootball fans grapple with violent side of a beloved sportVikings look to steady themselves for playoffs against BearsJets committed to help Wilson 'through hell or high water'Deebo Samuel could return in Week 18 for 49ersKEY MATCHUP: Joshua Dobbs, Tennessee’s third quarterback of the season, makes his second NFL start in six years against the team that traded a fifth-round pick for him in 2019. Dobbs threw for 232 yards last week without Henry in the backfield. He was signed Dec. 21 off Detroit’s practice squad and will have had six full practices, not counting walkthroughs. He threw 39 passes last week, the most by any Titans QB this season.INJURIES: The Titans should be their healthiest in weeks. They scratched seven starters for last week’s meaningless game against Dallas and expect to have OLB Denico Autry and two-time Pro Bowl DL Jeffery Simmons together for just the second time in seven games. Autry has a team-high eight sacks, with Simmons just behind at 7½. The Jaguars are in decent shape, with several guys recovering from injuries. LS Ross Matiscik is dealing with a back injury that’s preventing him from practicing much but he’s playing through it.ADVERTISEMENTSERIES NOTES: This is the first game in series history that’s been for the AFC South crown. ...
