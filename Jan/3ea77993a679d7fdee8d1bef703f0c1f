The NCAA also is looking at whether a member of Michigan’s off-field football staff violated rules by doing on-the-field coaching during practice.Harbaugh is accused of not being forthcoming about the potential violations, and the NCAA considers that unethical conduct and a Level I infraction. A text message was sent to Harbaugh on Thursday night, seeking comment.ADVERTISEMENTWhile the football program is dealing with an NCAA investigation, co-offensive coordinator Matt Weiss is on leave amid an investigation by university police into a report of computer access crimes over a three-day span last month at the team’s training facility.College footballStanford earns first Pac-12 win, beats Oregon State, 67-46Kendal Briles returns to Big 12 as TCU offensive coordinatorSouth Dakota State's Stiegelmeier retires, goes out on topPederson, Reid face off again as Jags visit KC for playoffsWeiss is accused of accessing email accounts at the school without proper authorization, according to another person familiar with the situation.
