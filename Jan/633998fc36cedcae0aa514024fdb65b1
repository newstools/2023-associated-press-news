(AP) — A 38-year-old retired NASA satellite is about to fall from the sky.NASA said Friday the chance of wreckage falling on anybody is “very low.” Most of the 5,400-pound (2,450-kilogram) satellite will burn up upon reentry, according to NASA. But some pieces are expected to survive.The space agency put the odds of injury from falling debris at about 1-in-9,400.The science satellite is expected to come down Sunday night, give or take 17 hours, according to the Defense Department.

Although its expected working lifetime was two years, the satellite kept making ozone and other atmospheric measurements until its retirement in 2005. The satellite studied how Earth absorbed and radiated energy from the sun.ADVERTISEMENTThe satellite got a special sendoff from Challenger. America’s first woman in space, Sally Ride, released the satellite into orbit using the shuttle’s robot arm. That same mission also featured the first spacewalk by a U.S. woman: Kathryn Sullivan.
