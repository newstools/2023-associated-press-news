COLUMBIA, Mo. (AP) — Kobe Brown scored 20 points, and D’Moi Hodge scored 17 points to help Missouri beat No. 12 Iowa State 78-61 in the SEC/Big 12 Challenge on Saturday. “To have a quad one win in January is very important,” Missouri coach Dennis Gates said. “I think that’s a two, a possible one-seed team. For us to have that quad one victory is very important, not only on Selection Sunday, but just for us in our growth to recognize who we are and also the confidence that we have in one another.”Brown scored 14 of his points in the first half and led Missouri (16-5) with 12 rebounds. Nick Honor added 12 points and DeAndre Gholston scored 10. “They had seven offensive rebounds, he had five of them,” Iowa State coach T.J. Otzelberger said about Brown. “He asserted his dominance, and he stepped up. He’s a tough matchup. He’s a hard cover, but I’d say more than that was how aggressive he was and his intent. His mindset was really impressive, so he certainly led that charge for them here.”ADVERTISEMENTJaren Holmes led Iowa State (15-5) with 19 points, and Gabe Kalscheur added 14. “They came out with a lot of confidence,” Otzelberger said about Missouri. “They shot the ball well early which allowed them to get their press set and put us on our heels a little bit more. I give all the credit to Missouri.” College basketballNo. 23 MTSU women win 16th straight, top FIU 67-41Joplin makes 8 3s, No. 16 Marquette beats DePaul 89-69Clark shines as No. 10 Iowa women edge Nebraska 80-76Clark's double-double leads No. 10 Iowa past Nebraska 80-76Missouri made 47% of its 30 3-point attempts, while Iowa State shot 40% from long range.
