CLEMSON, S.C. (AP) — Freshman Paulina Paris hit six 3-pointers, scored 22 points and had five steals — all career highs — and Kennedy Todd-Williams added 15 points Sunday to help No. 15 North Carolina hold off Clemson for a 69-58 win, the Tar Heels’ seventh in a row. No. 15 North Carolina (16-5, 7-3 ACC) hasn’t lost since a 62-58 defeat at Miami on Jan. 5 and the Tar Heels have won six straight — and 28 of the last 31 — against Clemson. Todd-Williams scored 10 points in the first 3 1/2 minutes, including back-to-back 3-pointers that capped a 14-4 opening run and UNC never trailed.Alyssa Ustby had seven points, 11 rebounds and three of North Carolina’s season-high tying 16 steals. Deja Kelly added nine points, six rebounds, six assists and two steals. Daisha Bradford led Clemson (13-10, 4-7) with 14 points and Amari Robinson scored 10. The Tigers shot 6 of 26 (23.1%) from the field — including 2 of 12 (17%) from 3-point range — hit just 33% (3 of 9) from the free-throw line and scored just 17 points in the first half. ADVERTISEMENTParis hit a 3-pointer to open the second half and give the Tar Heels their biggest lead at 39-17 with 8:47 left in the third but they went 2 for 13 from the field and committed five turnovers as Clemson trimmed its deficit to 43-39 going into the fourth. The Tigers ripped off 17 straight points during a 22-4 run — including eight points from Bradford — to close the third.
