LONDON (AP) — Steve Borthwick made his first big calls since being hired as England’s rugby coach, retaining Owen Farrell as captain despite his latest suspension and opting Monday to omit experienced players Billy Vunipola, Jonny May and Jack Nowell for the upcoming Six Nations tournament.Farrell is serving a four-match ban for a dangerous challenge while on club duty for Saracens and it will be reduced by one game if he completes a tackle course.In a controversial move that has been described as exploiting a loophole in the disciplinary process, Saracens’ match against Bristol on Jan. 28 has been included among the fixtures Farrell must miss, ensuring his availability to face Scotland on Feb. 4 in the opening round of the Six Nations.Players involved in Round 1 are stood down from the final round of club games before the Six Nations begins, yet it counts toward Farrell’s suspension in this instance.ADVERTISEMENTBorthwick said he had no hesitation in retaining Farrell as captain.“I know there has been a period of uncertainty around Owen’s availability,” Borthwick said. “I was informed unequivocally by the Rugby Football Union’s legal department on Friday that Owen would be available for the first game of the Six Nations.RugbyEddie Jones is in, Dave Rennie out as Wallabies head coachEx-rugby player Adair leads Ireland to T20 win over ZimbabweRichard Gasquet beats Cameron Norrie in Auckland ATP finalFarrell gets 4-game ban, should be available for 6 Nations“Owen accepts his suspension and can’t wait to be back on the field. My point of view is that I’m England head coach and my job is to select the players that are available to me. The disciplinary system is run completely as an independent process and I think we’d agree there should be that split — the England head coach and the disciplinary system should be completely separate, and that’s the case.”In picking a 36-man squad ahead of the Six Nations, Borthwick was heavily influenced by club form as he looks to build an England team that “plays with courage and fights in every single contest.”Borthwick has jettisoned three established performers under his predecessor, Eddie Jones, who was fired last month and has since been hired by Australia.Vunipola, the No. 8, and wingers May and Nowell were all involved in the 27-13 loss to South Africa that concluded the autumn series and ended the Jones era.While the trio were not part of the enlarged squad that will begin preparations next week for the Six Nations opener against Scotland, there were recalls for prop Dan Cole and versatile back Elliot Daly.ADVERTISEMENTCole was dropped by England after the 2019 Rugby World Cup final, while Daly has been frozen out since last year’s Six Nations despite his superb club form for Saracens.Northampton flyhalf Fin Smith earned a first call-up, providing cover for Owen Farrell and Marcus Smith, while Ollie Hassell-Collins, George McGuigan, Cadan Murley and Jack Walker were the other uncapped players selected.“We want an England squad where you have players competing for places. We sat for hours this week discussing selection and it should be that way,” Borthwick said. “It should be tough and there will be good players — really high-quality players — who are not selected.”___More AP rugby: https://apnews.com/hub/rugby and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports
