BOSTON (AP) â€” The Red Sox signed infielder Justin Turner to a one-year contract on Friday, adding a player they hope can help make up for the loss of All-Star infielder Xander Bogaerts in free agency. Left-hander Darwinzon Hernandez was designated for assignment to make room on the 40-man roster.The addition of the 38-year-old Turner comes on the heels of Boston agreeing to an 11-year contract worth $331 million with Rafael Devers to stay with the Red Sox, a person with knowledge of the agreement told The Associated Press on Wednesday.Turner entered free agency after the Los Angeles Dodgers declined their $16 million option on him. Turner was named MVP of the 2017 National League Championship Series, earned All-Star honors in 2017 and 2021 and helped the Dodgers win the World Series during the 2020 pandemic-shortened season.He hit .278 with 13 homers and 81 RBIs in 128 games after slumping early in the season. From the All-Star break on, he batted .340 before going 2 for 13 in the NL Division Series, where the Dodgers were eliminated.ADVERTISEMENTDuring his nine seasons in Los Angeles, he has been a fan favorite and active in the community. In November, he received the Roberto Clemente Award, which honors MLB players for their philanthropic efforts.MLBRockies claim reliever Nick Mears off waivers from RangersAP source: D-backs, Davies agree to 1-year deal for $5MUS to let MLB stars play for Cuba in World Baseball ClassicWisconsin takes on Oklahoma State in Guaranteed Rate BowlBogaerts finalized a $280 million, 11-year contract with San Diego last month.___AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports
