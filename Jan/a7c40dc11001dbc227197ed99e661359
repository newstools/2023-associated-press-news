KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) — New Zealand captain Tim Southee won the toss and elected to bat in the second test against Pakistan on Monday.New Zealand had made a strong bid to chase down 138 in the last hour of the first test of the two-match series last Friday after Pakistan captain Babar Azam made a daring declaration before poor visibility halted the Black Caps at 61-1 in the eighth over to draw the game.Pakistan added an extra fast bowler for the second test in hope a little grass left on the wicket would suit their seamers early on, as they left out leftarm spinner Nauman Ali and Mohammad Wasim.Hasan Ali was recalled, having last played for Pakistan against Sri Lanka in July and missing the 3-0 whitewash at the hands of England last month.Naseem Shah also returned after fully recovering from the shoulder injury that sidelined him from the last two test matches against England and the first test against the Black Caps.ADVERTISEMENTNew Zealand made one change and brought in fast bowler Matt Henry in place of Neil Wagner.Friday’s draw broke both team’s four-match losing streaks, which included 3-0 losses for each against the aggressive England.The Pakistan Cricket Board was forced to organize both test matches in Karachi due to weather concerns in Multan, where winter smog and fog have delayed flights and may have disrupted hours of play.CricketPakistan, New Zealand aim for much-awaited test winPakistan draws 1st test against NZ after daring declarationIndian cricketer Rishabh Pant hospitalized after car crashSt. Francis tops Central Connecticut 80-72 in NEC openerPakistan is languishing at No. 7 on the ICC world test championship table while New Zealand has endured even more disappointment and is 8th despite beating India in the inaugural WTC final at Lord’s last year.___Line-ups:New Zealand: Tom Latham, Devon Conway, Kane Williamson, Henry Nicholls, Daryl Mitchell, Tom Blundell, Michael Bracewell, Ish Sodhi, Tim Southee (captain), Matt Henry, Ajaz PatelPakistan: Abdullah Shafique, Imam-ul-Haq, Shan Masood, Babar Azam (captain), Saud Shakeel, Sarfaraz Ahmed, Agha Salman, Hasan Ali, Naseem Shah, Mir Hamza, Abrar Ahmed___More AP cricket: https://apnews.com/hub/cricket and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports
