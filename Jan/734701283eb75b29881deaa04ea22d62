Now do we want to score more? Yes we do. And do we want to move the ball better? Yes we do.”ADVERTISEMENTJaylyn Sherrod led Colorado with 16 points and three steals. Quay Miller had 14 points and nine rebounds and Aaronette Vonleh added 13 and 10 boards as the Buffaloes saw their seven-game win streak end.“We were really good defensively,” Colorado coach JR Payne said. “We just couldn’t score the ball.
