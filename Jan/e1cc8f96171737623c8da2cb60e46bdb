It is lined on both sides by huge lawns, canals and rows of trees, and has been renamed Kartavayapath (Boulevard of Duty).Workers who helped refurbish the boulevard, their families and maintenance workers were seated in front of the main dais during the parade as part of this year’s theme, “Participation of the Common People.”India traditionally invites foreign leaders to witness the parade. Former French President Francois Hollande was the guest of honor in 2016 and former U.S. President Barack Obama viewed it in 2015. Ten Southeast Asian leaders watched the parade in 2018.
