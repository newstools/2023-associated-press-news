Nobody else passed 2,000.Other highlights included saving a draw in the second test against Australia in Karachi with 196, his highest test score.He got his second straight ODI men’s award — the first to receive consecutive awards since Virat Kohli in 2017-18 — for leading Pakistan to wins in all three of its ODI series, and scoring 50 or more in eight of the nine matches.“The most satisfying and accomplishing aspect for me was to compete and perform in front of my home fans against Australia, England and New Zealand’s touring sides,” Babar said in an ICC statement. “Of course, reaching the finals of two major tournaments in the United Arab Emirates and Australia were also some of the highlights for me and my team, and we hope to do better this year.”Cricket3rd Zimbabwe-Ireland ODI washed out, series sharedICC rescinds demerit point given to Pindi Cricket StadiumPakistan appoints Haroon Rasheed as chief selectorAshleigh Gardner faults Australia Day match vs. PakistanADVERTISEMENTStokes has been leading England’s revolution in the test arena with a fearless attitude.
