OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) — Shai Gilgeous-Alexander scored 33 points, and the Oklahoma City Thunder beat the Dallas Mavericks 120-109 on Sunday night.It was supposed to be a showdown between two of the league’s top scorers in Gilgeous-Alexander and Dallas guard Luka Doncic, but Doncic — the NBA’s scoring leader with 34 points per game — sat out with a sore left ankle. Doncic had 34 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists Saturday in a win over the New Orleans Pelicans.Even with Doncic out, the Thunder knew they couldn’t afford to take it easy.“It’s a testament to their maturity and their commitment level,” Thunder coach Mark Daigneault said of his players. “And really, it’s (a) zero and zero mindset, it’s a 48-minute game, it’s being where your feet are inside of the game.”Gilgeous-Alexander, a guard who entered the night fourth in the league with 30.9 points per game, made 11 of 17 field goals and 11 of 13 free throws. Christian Wood, who led the Mavericks with 27 points and 16 rebounds, said his team knew the scouting report on Gilgeous-Alexander and it didn’t matter. ADVERTISEMENT“He’s a great player,” Wood said. “He’s been having a great season all year. He was getting left, getting downhill, getting to his spots, creating for others when he got to his spots, getting a lot of and-ones, getting to the free throw line.”NBAGarland, Mitchell lead Cavs past banged-up Suns 112-98Brink's big day helps No. 2 Stanford hold off Cal 60-56Grizzlies, without Morant, beat Jazz, extend win streak to 6Russell, Edwards help Timberwolves beat Rockets 104-96It was Oklahoma City’s third straight double-digit win at home to start the new year.

A steal by Gilgeous-Alexander led to a dunk by Lu Dort that put Oklahoma City ahead 116-98 with 4:26 to play.Daigneault said the Thunder turned the tide with defense.“Second-quarter defense was great, second-half defense was pretty good,” he said. “I thought they earned the stuff they got in the second half.”ADVERTISEMENTTIP-INSMavericks: Made 6 of 10 3-pointers in the first quarter to take a 34-33 lead.
