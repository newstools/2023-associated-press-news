DENVER (AP) — Nikola Jokic had 21 points, 18 rebounds and nine assists before sitting out the fourth quarter and the Denver Nuggets won their 12th straight home game, routing the weary and short-handed Phoenix Suns 126-97 on Wednesday night. Bones Hyland added 21 points and Jamal Murray had 16 to help the Nuggets win for the 14th time in 17 games. They reached the halfway point of the season tied with Memphis for the Western Conference lead. “But we’re not satisfied,” said Hyland, who hit five of Denver’s 15 3-pointers. A night after winning at Golden State despite missing four starters and six rotation players, the Suns ran out of gas playing a back-to-back at altitude while dressing 10 players. Torrey Craig scored 16 points and Josh Okogie added 14 points and nine rebounds for the Suns. They have dropped 10 of 12. “They posted up Jokic early and just flattened us out (defensively),” Suns coach Monty Williams said. “And he does a really good job of finding the open man or scoring.” ADVERTISEMENTPhoenix started the second quarter with an 8-second violation and things only got worse. Hyland hit all four of his 3s in the period, Jokic had a rebound and put-back using only one hand and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope hit his fourth 3 in the half without a miss as Denver built a 23-point lead.

The two-time reigning MVP rested in the fourth instead of pursuing his 12th triple-double of the season against the overwhelmed Suns. Phoenix remained without Devin Booker (groin), Chris Paul (hip), Deandre Ayton (ankle), Cameron Johnson (knee), Landry Shamet (hip) and Cameron Payne (foot), and also is without Jae Crowder. Guard Saben Lee, a Phoenix area product, signed a 10-day contract before the game and scored eight points. “It’s good to have another body down there,” Williams said. “When I look down there and see more coaches than players, I’m like ... this is ... yeah, I’ll stop there.” The absences soured the rematch of the Christmas night overtime thriller won by the Nuggets behind Jokic’s 41-point triple-double and Aaron Gordon’s power dunk over Shamet.

BACK-TO-BACK BLUESWilliams was unhappy playing consecutive nights in San Francisco and Denver. It involved moving ahead one time zone, dealing with the lengthy drive from Denver’s airport to downtown and adjusting to the mile-high altitude. Nuggets coach Michael Malone called it “the toughest back-to-back in the business.” At least ESPN picked up the game and moved the tipoff back an hour. “When you fly two hours and have to drive 30-40 minutes, that’s a lot on any team,” Williams said.TIP-INSSuns: Their 22 losses are four more than all of last season. ...
