LOS ANGELES (AP) — Those killed by a gunman who opened fire at a Los Angeles-area dance hall are being remembered by friends and family for the zest for life that brought them out that night to celebrate the Lunar New Year.Eleven people were killed when a gunman opened fire on Saturday night at the Star Ballroom Dance Studio, a dance hall in Monterey Park that is popular with older Asian Americans.“It’s always happy, people just come and have fun, they just love dancing,” Peter Phung, a singer who has performed there and frequently stopped by to sing karaoke as well, told The Associated Press on Thursday.Following the attack, the gunman went to another nearby ballroom but was disarmed before anyone was shot. He fled — and on Sunday shot and killed himself.As the week went on, a makeshift memorial with flowers and photos grew in front of the Star Ballroom. And as of Thursday, a GoFundMe organized by the Asian Americans Advancing Justice Southern California was nearing $1 million for the families of the victims.ADVERTISEMENTHere are profiles of the 11 people killed:DIANA TOMDiana Tom, 70, was a “hard-working mother, wife and grandmother who loved to dance,” her family said in a statement provided to The Associated Press.TaiwanCardinals' Nootbaar, Boston's Yoshida in Japan's WBC teamPassion for dance drew many of those slain to ballroomEx-student gets 8 years for spying for Chinese governmentThe AP Interview takeaways: Pope decries expanding gun useHer family said that she went to the ballroom to celebrate the Lunar New Year by dancing with her friends.“To those who knew her, she was someone who always went out of her way to give to others,” her family said.Phung, the singer, remembered Tom as “very friendly, outgoing,” and said that in addition to her passion for dance, she would also frequently perform karaoke at the venue.Tom’s family said that after she was wounded at the Star Ballroom, she was hospitalized in critical condition.
