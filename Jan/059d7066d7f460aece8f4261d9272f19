LONDON (AP) — England’s injury problems worsened Tuesday ahead of the Six Nations rugby tournament, with Jamie George withdrawn from the squad to add to an escalating crisis at hooker.With 11 days until its opening game against Scotland at Twickenham, England could be without its three best hookers — George, Luke Cowan-Dickie and George McGuigan.George is out of the squad because of a head injury sustained on club duty with Saracens, Cowan-Dickie is sidelined with an ankle injury that could make him a long-term absentee, while McGuigan has a knee injury.Versatile back Elliot Daly dropped out of the squad because of a hamstring injury and England announced Monday that lock Courtney Lawes sustained a calf problem at the weekend and could miss the Scotland game.Lawes, one of England’s vice captains, will miss at least one week of training having missed the entire autumn series because of a concussion.England has called up three hookers as cover — Jamie Blamire, Tom Dunn and Jack Walker.___More AP rugby: https://apnews.com/hub/rugby and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports
