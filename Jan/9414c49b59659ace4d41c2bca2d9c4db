LIVERPOOL, England (AP) — Liverpool center back Virgil van Dijk is expected to be sidelined for at least a month because of a hamstring injury, manager Jurgen Klopp said Friday.The Netherlands captain was taken off at halftime of Monday’s 3-1 loss at Brentford and underwent scans this week.“The diagnosis was pretty harsh and we talk about weeks, more than a month, but I hope that it goes quick,” Klopp said at a press conference ahead of Liverpool’s FA Cup match against Wolverhampton on Saturday.Klopp replaced Van Dijk with Joel Matip at Brentford as a precaution and wasn’t expecting bad news.“It was a surprise for us. It was obviously a big blow. He didn’t feel a lot,” Klopp said.___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports
