FRESNO, Calif. (AP) — Isaih Moore scored 16 points and Fresno State beat the last unbeaten team in the nation in No. 21 New Mexico, topping the Lobos 71-67 on Tuesday night.Isaiah Hill added 14 points, making three free throws in the final seconds to wrap up the victory for the Bulldogs (6-8, 2-1 Mountain West).“It’s definitely a physical fight tonight,” Hill said. “It came down to some free throws, and we had to make them.”Jemarl Baker added 13 points and five assists, and 6-foot-11 Eduardo Andre, averaging just over four points a game, scored a career-high 12 points and had eight rebounds. “This group has been working really hard, and they stick with it, and that’s what it’s about, right?” Fresno State coach Justin Hutson said. “ To continue to stick with it, stick through the good times and bad times. We’ve had some defeats that we didn’t like.”After sitting out for over nine minutes of the second half with four fouls, Andre returned with 20 seconds left and the Bulldogs leading 70-67. He blocked a layup by Jamal Mashburn Jr. and grabbed the rebound, leading to Hill’s final free throws.ADVERTISEMENT“I told the team we have to keep it in perspective,” Lobos coach Richard Pitino said. “We are 14-1. It’s been an unbelievable run to go two months without a loss. It is tough to win on the road, especially in conference. We will try not to get too emotional about this, but just get back home and learn from it.”College basketballNowell scores 36 as K-State rolls over No. 6 Texas 116-103No. 5 UConn beats Butler despite missing 2 starters, coachAndrews leads No. 23 Baylor women past No. 17 Oklahoma 81-70Vescovi, Zeigler lead No. 8 Vols to 87-53 rout of Miss St.Mashburn finished with 22 points for New Mexico (14-1, 2-1).
