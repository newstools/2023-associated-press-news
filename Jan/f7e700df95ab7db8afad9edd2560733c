KOLKATA, India (AP) — India recovered from a precarious 86-4 to beat Sri Lanka by four wickets and take the series in the second one-day international on Thursday.Lokesh Rahul led India with an unbeaten 64 after facing 103 balls. Kuldeep Yadav hit the winning boundary in the 44th over to give India 219-6 in reply to Sri Lanka’s 215 all out.“We thought it was a 280-300 wicket. But our bowlers did well to keep them to under 220,” Rahul said. “They put up a good fight and got breakthroughs. It wasn’t a wicket impossible to bat on, and we always try to find a way to win. Batting at No. 5 has helped me understand my game better.” India has an unassailable 2-0 lead with the last ODI scheduled for Sunday at Thiruvananthapuram.Earlier, Yadav picked 3-51 to help bowl out Sri Lanka — 102-1 at one point — with 10.2 overs to spare.Sri Lanka debutant Nuwanidu Fernando opened with a sedate maiden half-century before enduring a careless runout. He scored 50 off 63 balls.ADVERTISEMENTFernando put on 73 runs for the second wicket with Kusal Mendis (34). But when Mendis was trapped by Yadav in the 17th over, Sri Lanka collapsed.Yadav also dismissed Charitha Asalanka (15) and bowled Dasun Shanaka (2) as Sri Lanka fell from 102-1 to 126-6 in 7.2 overs.
