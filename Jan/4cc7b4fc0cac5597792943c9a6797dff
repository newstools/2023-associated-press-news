Kelly scored seven points — including the final five — in a 9-2 spurt to give North Carolina the lead for good and make it 18-11 at the end of the first quarter. Freshman Tonie Morgan led Georgia Tech (10-10, 1-8) with 15 points and eight rebounds, and Cameron Swartz scored 13. Morgan, who had 16 points and a career-high 15 rebounds last time out, made 6 of 9 from the field while the rest of the Yellow Jackets shot just 30.2% (16 of 53). Todd-Williams hit a 3-pointer to give UNC a 10-point lead with 2 minutes left in the second quarter and Kelly made another as time expired to make it 37-28 at halftime.
