WACO, Texas (AP) — Ismael Massoud hit a 3-pointer with 31 seconds left in overtime and Kansas State extended its winning streak to eight games with a 97-95 victory Saturday night at No. 19 Baylor, where new Wildcats head coach Jerome Tang was on staff the past 19 seasons. Markquis Nowell had 32 points for the Wildcats (14-1, 3-0 Big 12), and his 14th assist of the game was on the go-ahead 3 by Massoud. Baylor then called timeout and appeared to be trying to set up a game-ending shot before Adam Flagler, who had 23 points, was surrounded by three defenders when he lost the ball out of bounds with 6.1 seconds left. Keyontae Johnson added 24 points and nine rebounds for K-State, which matched its best overall start since 1958-59, and is 3-0 in the Big 12 for the first time in 10 seasons. The Wildcats were coming of their single-game scoring record in a 116-103 win at sixth-ranked Texas on Tuesday night.
