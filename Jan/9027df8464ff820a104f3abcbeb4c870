DETROIT (AP) — Antoine Davis of Detroit Mercy set the NCAA record for career 3-pointers on Saturday, hitting a career-best 11 3s and scoring a season-high 41 points in an 87-75 win over Robert Morris.Davis shot 11 for 18 from long distance and was 15 for 26 overall. His 11 3-pointers increased his career total to 513, eclipsing the previous record of 509 by Fletcher Magee of Wofford from 2014-19. Davis entered the game chasing Magee and Oakland’s Travis Bader (504 3s from 2010-14).Davis said his focus was on a much-needed win for Detroit Mercy, not the NCAA record.“To be honest, I wasn’t thinking about it. I was just playing,” Davis said of his pursuit of the record. “So, once I hit like five or six in a row, I figured I was going to get it.“It means everything. Another record for the history books. Another blessing. I’m just so thankful for it.”Davis, a 6-foot-1, fifth-year guard, had his fifth career game of 40 points, tied for 13th in school history.
