ISLAMABAD (AP) — The Pakistan Cricket Board appointed former middle-order batter Haroon Rasheed as chief selector on Monday.Rasheed will replace Shahid Afridi, who had been appointed interim chief selector ahead of Pakistan’s second test match against New Zealand late last month.Afridi also selected the ODI team which lost to New Zealand 2-1 but cited his commitments to his foundation and charity work as the reason to stand down.Rasheed previously served as chief selector in 2015-16 and also played 23 test matches and 12 ODIs for Pakistan from 1977-83. He has also served as the PCB’s director of cricket operations and as the national team’s manager.Rasheed was also one of the 14 members of the new PCB management committee which was appointed last month, but will step down from the committee after being appointed chief selector.“Haroon has now resigned from the management committee as we don’t want a conflict of interest after his appointment as the chief selector,” PCB management committee chairman Najam Sethi said.Pakistan’s next internationals will be a three-match T20 series against Afghanistan in the United Arab Emirates.___More AP cricket: https://apnews.com/hub/cricket and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports
