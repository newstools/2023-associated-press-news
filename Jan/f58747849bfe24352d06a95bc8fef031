NEW YORK (AP) — Bradley Beal is back in the starting lineup for the Washington Wizards after missing five games with a left hamstring strain.Coach Wes Unseld Jr. said the Wizards would be cautious Wednesday with Beal’s minutes against the New York Knicks, because he has been troubled by the hamstring multiple times this season.
