WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) — Carter Hart made 40 saves for his first shutout of the season in the Philadelphia Flyers’ 4-0 victory over the Winnipeg Jets on Saturday night.“It’s obviously nice,” Hart said. “There were a lot of big blocks, a lot of good sticks in lanes. They do a lot of seam passes and we did a good job of denying that.”Noah Cates had a goal and an assist, Kieffer Bellows, Owen Tippett and Tony DeAngelo also scored, and Rasmus Ristolainen added two assists in the Flyers’ final game before the All-Star break.“Going into the break, you just empty the tank and you’re not too worried about how you’re going to feel for the next game,” Cates said. “We’re feeling good about ourselves going into the break with a win. We’ve had a really good month here in January and we’ve got a couple of more big months coming down the stretch.”Philadelphia (21-21-9) is 7-1-1 in its last nine road games.ADVERTISEMENTConnor Hellebuyck stopped 26 shots for Winnipeg before being relieved by David Rittich.
