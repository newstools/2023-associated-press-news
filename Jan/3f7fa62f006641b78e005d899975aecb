SPOKANE, Wash. (AP) — Malachi Smith had a season-high 27 points, hitting seven 3-pointers, and No. 8 Gonzaga used a dominant first half to rout Portland 115-75 on Saturday night.Gonzaga (16-3, 5-0 West Coast Conference) never trailed, racing to a 40-14 lead with seven minutes left in the first half en route to its NCAA-best 75th straight home victory and 15th straight win over Portland.Gonzaga unleashed a flurry of 3s early on, hitting six through the first 10 minutes while Portland (9-11, 1-4) shot 0 for 9 from behind the arc during that time.“We knew their game plan was to pack the paint and so coach was telling us just to be ready to shoot,” Smith said. “And we were ready. Once you hit that first shot you know, it just gets easier. The rim just starts to look like an ocean.” Following a 75-74 victory at BYU on Thursday night, coach Mark Few wanted to be sure the effort was the same tonight. ADVERTISEMENT“By and large it was a really good effort, especially coming off of an emotional win and then dealing with a quick turnaround,” Few said. “Malachi and Julian (Strawther) just shoot it really deep effortlessly, so I think that helps us spread things out.”Portland cut the deficit to 17 with 5:16 left in the half, but the Bulldogs responded with a 19-3 run, and Gonzaga led 61-28 at half.College basketballChappell helps Sac State hold off Northern Arizona 59-56No. 7 UCLA rallies in 2nd half for 68-54 win over ColoradoSiegrist, No. 25 Villanova rally to beat St. John's 64-61Maxwell hits 6 3s, No. 12 Gonzaga women beat Portland 73-66Drew Timme scored 18 points for Gonzaga.
