The Swede competed in the 1970s and ’80s.Shiffrin’s next chance will be in March when she resumes World Cup racing after the Feb. 6-19 world championships in France. World championship races do not count toward World Cup wins.“I don’t have any expectations going into it,” Shiffrin said about her next World Cup event, which will be either speed races in Kvitfjell, Finland on March 4-5 or tech races in Are, Sweden the following week.“It’s just like every race of the season, trying to take it all in and enjoy – enjoy my skiing, enjoy when the other athletes are skiing better. Because there is always some to learn from that.”ADVERTISEMENTShiffrin had broken a tie on the all-time women’s list with former American teammate Lindsey Vonn last Tuesday.
