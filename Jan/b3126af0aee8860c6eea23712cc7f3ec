Players and their teams have been briefed and reminded of the event policy regarding flags and symbols and to avoid any situation that has the potential to disrupt,” Tennis Australian said in a statement. “We continue to work closely with event security and law enforcement agencies.” ADVERTISEMENTOn Jan. 17, the second day of the Australian Open, flags from Russia and Belarus were banned from Melbourne Park after more than one was brought into the stands by spectators the day before.TennisRybakina, Sabalenka to meet in Australian Open women's finalAustralian Open lookahead: Djokovic faces Paul in semifinalsTommy Paul's Australian run helps make US men relevant againPiqué’s Kosmos group sues ITF over Davis Cup partnershipNormally, flags can be displayed during matches at Melbourne Park.

Russia invaded, with help from Belarus, in February.Russian and Belarusian players have been allowed to play at the Australian Open, French Open and U.S. Open, but as “neutral” athletes, so their nationalities are not acknowledged on any official schedules or results for the event and their countries’ flags are not displayed on TV graphics.At the Australian Open, two women who represent Belarus — Victoria Azarenka and Aryna Sabalenka — and one man who represents Russia — Karen Khachanov — reached the singles semifinals.ADVERTISEMENTOn Wednesday, the International Olympic Committee said athletes should not be penalized for their nationality and made clear it wants Russians to be able to compete at the 2024 Paris Olympics as “neutral” athletes. ___AP tennis: https://apnews.com/hub/tennis and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports
