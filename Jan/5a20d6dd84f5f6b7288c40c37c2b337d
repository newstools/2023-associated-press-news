WENGEN, Switzerland (AP) — Henrik Kristoffersen raced through steady falling snow to win a World Cup slalom Sunday and give Norway a three-race weekend sweep.For the third straight day, in three different disciplines, a Norwegian won with a home Swiss racer runner-up.Kristoffersen finished 0.20 seconds ahead of first-run leader Loïc Meillard who was denied giving Switzerland a first win for 36 years in its classic World Cup slalom.Lucas Braathen was third, 0.49 behind his Norway teammate Kristoffersen, one week after he won the slalom at nearby Adelboden. Other racers were all at least one second further back.Kristoffersen’s 30th career World Cup win lifted him back into the lead over Braathen in the season-long slalom standings. The gap is just 10 points, 320-310.He completed the Norwegian sweep at Wengen just as he did in 2016, when Aksel Lund Svindal won the downhill and Kjetil Jansrud won the Alpine combined.ADVERTISEMENTThis time, the Norway triple was started by Aleksander Aamodt Kilde winning in super-G and downhill. The runners-up were, respectively, Stefan Rogentin and Marco Odermatt, who has a big lead in the overall World Cup standings. Odermatt does not start in slalom. Falling snow that has been rare in Europe in a warm January slowed the course in the second run of a tricky race Sunday.
