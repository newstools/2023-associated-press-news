With Kawhi and PG (Paul George) on the floor, we play at a high level.”The Clippers had seven players score in double figures, including Norman Powell with 26 points and George had 16 points and 12 assists. Los Angeles shot 63% from the field, 54% on 3-pointers and had 31 assists. Keldon Johnson had 23 points for San Antonio, which has lost nine of 11.

Leonard was honored before the game with a video highlighting his seven seasons in San Antonio. There was a smattering of boos, but nothing to the level of jeers he received in previous appearances in San Antonio.“It’s been a long journey,” Leonard said. “The fans are very competitive here. When I’m at the games you might hear boos, but if I’m walking on the street or going to restaurants, people come up to me and still tell me how much they love my game and like me as a person. So, I know it’s just a competition once I’m here. I understand.” UP NEXTClippers: At Dallas on Sunday. Spurs: At Portland on Monday.
