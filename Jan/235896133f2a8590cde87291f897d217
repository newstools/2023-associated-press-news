WASHINGTON (AP) — The Biden administration said Thursday it’s time for Turkey to ratify Finland and Sweden’s applications to join NATO, bluntly saying that holdout members of the alliance should quickly approve their memberships. The State Department said Secretary of State Antony Blinken had affirmed resolute support for Finland and Sweden in phone calls with their foreign ministers and said the U.S. places great importance on “remaining allies quickly ratifying their accession.”In nearly identical statements about the two calls released just 13 minutes apart, State Department spokesman Ned Price said Blinken had “reiterated U.S. support for Finland and Sweden’s NATO accession.”“He conveyed again our firm belief that Finland and Sweden are ready to join the alliance,” Price said of the calls with Swedish Foreign Minister Tobias Billstrom and Finnish Foreign Minister Pekka Haavisto. “The United States urges remaining allies to quickly ratify their accession.” ADVERTISEMENTThe statements did not mention Turkey by name, but the calls came just a day after Blinken met with the foreign minister of Turkey, whose country is the most ardent NATO holdout against Finland and Sweden joining the alliance.NATONATO allies US, Turkey try to mend fences but rifts persistAt Davos, Zelenskyy urges allies to speed up push vs. RussiaNATO warns of Russia's long war in Ukraine, vows to be readyUS, Ukraine top military chiefs meet in person for 1st timeThe two countries applied for NATO membership last year after becoming alarmed by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

Turkey has demanded that Sweden in particular do more to rein in these Kurdish groups before agreeing to its accession to NATO.
