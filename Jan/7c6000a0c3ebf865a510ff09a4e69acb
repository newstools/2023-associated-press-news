Jim Harbaugh is staying at Michigan, a decision he personally gave the school president to end another round of speculation that he would return to the NFL.“I just got off the phone with coach Harbaugh and Jim shared with me the great news that he is going to remain as the head coach of the Michigan Wolverines,” University of Michigan President Santa Ono shared on social media Monday. “That is fantastic news that I have communicated with our athletic director Warde Manuel.”One minute later, Michigan football shared a statement from Harbaugh on Twitter.“My heart is at the University of Michigan,” Harbaugh’s statement read in the post. “I once heard a wise man say, `Don’t try to out-happy, happy.’”Harbaugh and the school have not reached an agreement on a contract extension, but both sides plan to work on a new deal this week, according to a person familiar with the situation. The person spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because details of the negotiations were not announced.ADVERTISEMENTThe Denver Broncos and Carolina Panthers spoke with Harbaugh about their head coaching vacancies this month and he was mentioned as a potential candidate for the Indianapolis Colts, one of four teams he played quarterback for in the league from 1987 to 2000 after being a star for the Wolverines.College footballFormer NFL player arrested in Mississippi on kidnap chargeVillanova extends Georgetown's Big East losing streak to 28Ohio State QB C.J.
