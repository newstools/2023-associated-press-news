SHAYBAH, Saudi Arabia (AP) — Nasser Al-Attiyah hung close to his pursuers in the vast expanse of dunes in southeast Saudi Arabia and closed in on his fifth Dakar Rally title on Thursday.Al-Attiyah wasn’t possessive for a second straight day about the Empty Quarter that is considered his backyard. Instead, the Qatari eased to fifth on the 11th stage, the first 273 kilometers of a two-day marathon special in the desert.He conceded less than seven minutes to Sebastien Loeb, who won a fourth consecutive stage and fifth in this Dakar after an early puncture. Loeb is only the fourth driver in the elite car category to win four successive specials, and first since Carlos Sainz in 2009.Also finishing just seconds behind Brazilian rookie Lucas Moraes meant Al-Attiyah remained in control, more than 80 minutes ahead of Moraes, and more than 90 up on Loeb. Al-Attiyah’s Toyota teammate, Henk Lategan, was the only other driver within two hours.ADVERTISEMENT“We don’t need to attack for nothing. We still have too many hours to do,” Al-Attiyah said. “Today, we just needed to finish. We need to control because there is no point really going crazy.”Loeb took just under three hours to win the stage from Shaybah down to the Oman border, two minutes ahead of French compatriot Guerlain Chicherit.Auto RacingHarvick: 'It's just time,' racer says of 2023 final seasonNext Gen car leveled NASCAR field in 2022, possibly beyondCaesars touts F1 Las Vegas Grand Prix VIP package worth $5MJust like dad: Mick Schumacher goes from Ferrari to MercedesChicherit rebounded a day after hitting a huge hole, slamming his head and driving ill to the finish.
