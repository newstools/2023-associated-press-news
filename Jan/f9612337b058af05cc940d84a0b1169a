The three-time All-Star was scheduled to begin treatment on Monday.“Hearing the word “Cancer” came as a shock to my wife and I, as it does to millions of families each year,” he wrote. “However, I am resolved to embrace the fight and overcome this new challenge with the same determination I have used when facing other obstacles in my life.”Hendriks said he is “confident” he will “make a full recovery and be back on the mound as soon as possible.”“I know with the support of my wife, my family, my teammates and the Chicago White Sox organization, along with the treatment and care from my doctors, I will get through this,” he said.The five-year survival rate for non-Hodgkin lymphoma is 73.8%, according to the National Cancer Institute.

Knowing everyone involved, especially Liam, we are optimistic he will pitch again for the White Sox as soon as viable. In the meantime, we all will do everything in our power to support our teammate and his family as they face this challenge, while also respecting their privacy.”MLBMariners acquire right-hander Justin Topa from BrewersRockies claim reliever Nick Mears off waivers from RangersAP source: D-backs, Davies agree to 1-year deal for $5MUS to let MLB stars play for Cuba in World Baseball ClassicHendriks was third in the majors with 37 saves and made his third All-Star team last season.
