MADISON, Wis. (AP) — The city of Luck, Wisconsin, is living up to its namesake. WISN-TV reported Thursday that someone bought a $15.1 million Megabucks-winning ticket at Wayne’s Food Plus grocery store in the northwestern Wisconsin city. The winning numbers were 4-6-12-17-27-28. It’s the largest Megabucks jackpot won since a $22.2 million jackpot in 2015. Wayne’s Food Plus store manager Paul Wondra says the ticket buyer “truly got lucky in Luck.”The Wisconsin-only game has drawings on Wednesdays and Saturdays.
